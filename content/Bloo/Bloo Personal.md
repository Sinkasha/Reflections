# Bloo Personal

Level 6 Aberrant Mind Sorcerer Level 2 Genie Djinni Warlock
Chaotic Good

## Traits:

- Principles / Important Traits:
  - I will only kill in self-defense / revenge. Never for pleasure or money. (Found in [[Bloo's Backstory#Arc 1: Existing|Arc 1]])
  - I take a while to make friends, but once I do, I am fiercely loyal. (Take a awhile to make friends will come from a later arc, fiercely loyal just generally as a trait)
  - When I go adventuring, I will try _very hard_ to make sure my teammates live. (Likely come from arc with the girl, year 321 ish)
  - I have a soft place in my heart for the poor. (Found in [[Bloo's Backstory#Arc 1: Existing|Arc 1]])
- Personal Goals:
  - Figure out who I am / where I came from
- Personality:
  - A dichotomy: look super edgy but very sweet on the inside
  - In battle, shit better start dying because I want my teammates to live
  - Quiet, don't speak too much. I use Minor Illusion to speak because I'm mute and will only ever speak right beside someone's ear.
- I am a sentient blob of moss. I squish along, taking over dead bodies by effectively replacing their head. I can yeet myself off of the corpse (in an action) 3 feet away.
- A psychic wind from the Astral Plane carried psionic energy to you. When you use your powers, faint motes of light sparkle around you.
- I always carry around a jar. In case I blob-ify and need to sleep, I sleep in the jar. It's got a yogurt label on it. Blob likes the smell of strawberry yogurt. There's also little stickers and random stuff I find at the bottom. A _very shiny_ gold coin. That's not actually money. There was an attempt at drawing a self-portrait on the jar. It's just a greenish circle with sunglasses.
- Blob canonically has sunglasses with tinted lens. But only in blob form.
- Blob will start the campaign in a Kenku's corpse. With a raven mask on. Because I don't _actually_ have a head.
- Not technically undead.
- My long rest is a 4-hour-long trance, like an elf
- Every new corpse, I will retain the traffic cone hat and the raven mask

To understand each other, you each must speak mentally in a language the other knows.
  - The telepathic connection lasts for a number of minutes equal to your sorcerer level. It ends early if you are incapacitated or die or if you use this ability to form a connection with a different creature.
- Font of Magic (_2nd level sorc. feature_)
  - At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.
  - You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain one additional point every time you level up, to a maximum of 20 at level 20. You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.
  - You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels.
  - You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The created spell slots vanish at the end of a long rest. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level. You can create spell slots no higher in level than 5th.

  - At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level. You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.
  - **Quickened Spell**
    - When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.
  - **Twinned Spell**
    - When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).
    - To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell's current level. For example, magic missile and scorching ray aren't eligible, but ray of frost and chromatic orb are.
- ASI (_4th level sorc. feature_)
  - Take Fey Touched, CHA + 1, and then misty-step + Silvery Barbs, and then replace silvery barbs from sorc. spells known with Invisibility
- Psionic Sorcery (_6th-level Aberrant Mind feature_)
  - When you cast any spell of 1st level or higher from your Psionic Spells feature, you can cast it by expending a spell slot as normal or by spending a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level.
  - If you cast the spell using sorcery points, it requires no verbal or somatic components, and it requires no material components, unless they are consumed by the spell.
- Psychic Defenses (_6th-level Aberrant Mind feature_)

  - STRAWBERRY GENIE
  - Genie vessel is strawberry yogurt jar

  - If the vessel is destroyed or you lose it, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and the previous vessel is destroyed if it still exists. The vessel vanishes in a flare of elemental power when you die.
- Bottled Respite (_1st-level Genie Warlock feature_)
  - As an action, you can magically vanish and enter your vessel, which remains in the space you left. The interior of the vessel is an extradimensional space in the shape of a 20-foot-radius cylinder, 20 feet high, and resembles your vessel. The interior is appointed with cushions and low tables and is a comfortable temperature. While inside, you can hear the area around your vessel as if you were in its space. You can remain inside the vessel up to a **number of hours equal to twice your proficiency bonus**. You exit the vessel early if you use a bonus action to leave, if you die, or if the vessel is destroyed. When you exit the vessel, you appear in the unoccupied space closest to it. Any objects left in the vessel remain there until carried out, and if the vessel is destroyed, every object stored there harmlessly appears in the unoccupied spaces closest to the vessel's former space. Once you enter the vessel, you can't enter again until you finish a long rest.
- Genie's Wrath (_1st-level Genie Warlock feature_)
