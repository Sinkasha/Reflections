## Bloo Planning
*AKA Dead Cells Blob*
##### [[Bloo's Backstory]]

Deception, Intimidation for prof. in Sorc.

##### Character Traits:
- I am a sentient blob of moss. I squish along, taking over dead bodies by effectively replacing their head. I can yeet myself off of the corpse (in an action) 3 feet away. I can't speak so I use Minor Illusion to speak. I'm going to be super creepy though. If I'm talking to someone, I'm always going to Minor Illusion my voice to be right beside their ear. Cause I can't speak myself and I just never understand that that's not how talking works. 
- I'm an Aberrant Mind sorcerer. 
- A psychic wind from the Astral Plane carried psionic energy to you. When you use your powers, faint motes of light sparkle around you. I retain no memory of myself pre-blob. Large amounts of my backstory will be determined by the DM. 
- Ultimate goal: figure out who I am / where I came from
- Personality: I want to be a dichotomy. I'm going to look *super* edgy. But, I'm gonna be super sweet. Except in battle, where shit better start dying. I'm going to be stupidly loyal. I make friends reluctantly but once they're my friend, you bet I'll defend them with my life. Or I'll spend all my time avenging them. I will also be very quiet, not speaking too much. 
- I always carry around a jar. In case I blob-ify and need to sleep, I sleep in the jar. It's got a yogurt label on it. Blob likes the smell of strawberry yogurt. There's also little stickers and random stuff I find at the bottom. A _very shiny_ gold coin. That's not actually money. There was an attempt at drawing a self-portrait on the jar. It's just a green-ish circle with sunglasses.
- Blob canonically has sunglasses with tinted lens. But only in blob form. 
- Blob will start the campaign in a kenku's corpse. With a crow mask on. Because I don't *actually* have a head. 
- Not technically undead.
- My long rest is a 4 hour long trance, like an elf
- Principles:
	- I will only kill in self-defense / revenge. Never for pleasure or money. 
	- I take awhile to make friends, but once I do, I am fiercely loyal. 

- Possible Feats: Eldritch Adept, Fey Touched
