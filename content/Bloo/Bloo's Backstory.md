##### Arc 1: Existing

One day, I existed. What came before was darkness in my mind. I could not remember how or when I got... I had no idea where I was. It was night, with only a thin sliver of moon amidst an inky void shining through the leaves.

I was right up on the ground. It came to me suddenly that I was not particularly large, perhaps the size of a human head... What _is_ a human head anyways? My mind was awash with words: shadows, owl, moon, night, leaves, grass, breeze. Yet... I had no memory of learning them. I felt the passage of time within me with no recollection of its passing.

When the moon had almost sunk beneath the trees and swatches of violent magenta painted the dark clouds, I finally succeeded in... I had no body. I was small because I was merely... a blob. I had moved not through the power of legs (what are legs?) but what felt to be sheer willpower. I had... rolled... As fiery rays of light filled the sky, I learned to walk. More accurately, I learned to roll, to climb with the aid of my stickiness. I was a sticky blob.

In commemoration of my discovery, I gave myself a name: Bloo. Bloo the blob. I could not remember what was my name, yet something told me I needed one.

As I moved through the forest, I heard birds chirping and the scurrying of small animals and panicked footsteps. As I approached a clearing, a robed humanoid leapt from the trees, looking behind as they landed (legs!). They were wearing a black cloak, face covered by an elaborate raven mask. Right after the raven mask landed, another robed humanoid leapt out, wearing a blank white mask which completely concealed their features. Before the raven mask could draw their sword, the blank mask stabbed a dagger into the back of their neck before leaping away again, leaving only the quivering of leaves and a quiet thump of a corpse.

The forest was silent.

Crimson red seeped into the soil.

The shocked silence lasted mere moments before vultures alighted, eagerly picking away at the fresh corpse. Something drew me to the corpse. Perhaps a morbid curiosity. Perhaps a desire to chase away the vultures. The vultures were not frightened of the small blob which came before them. Their beady eyes watched me, unfazed. When I got too close, they angrily stabbed at me with their beaks.

What could I do? I was a blob. A squishy blob. As the anger at my weakness overtook me, I saw glimmers of light surround me, a mysterious voice whispered "it is inevitable", and strands of moss which I soon recognized to be my hands waved in my sight. Three glowing darts streaked from me towards the vultures.

As the calls of the vultures faded into the distance, the glimmers of light floated into the grass. Silence fell once again. I had cast a spell. A quiet voice echoed in my mind, "Magic Missile." Was that the name of the spell? Who was in my mind? Who had whispered? Why was I made of moss?

As I contemplated these existential questions, I moved towards the corpse. Before I understood what I was doing, I had pulled the hood of the corpse back, revealing curly black hair. It was a human head. (So _that's_ a human head!) An urge rose within me, unbidden, and I felt my moss blob body envelop the corpse's head.

The world stopped. Briefly.

When I came to, I felt different. My attempts at rolling around were futile. I felt the discomfort of my arm be- I don't have an arm. Confused, I opened my eyes. I couldn't see with my face against the ground, but I could smell the tangy smell of blood mixed with the smell of fresh grass. I pulled the arm from beneath the body. The movements felt familiar, as if I had once been a humanoid. On slightly wobbly feet, I stood up. The raven mask lay at my feet. Disoriented, I wandered around the forest with my newfound body, reveling in the height it offered me.

Presently, I came to a quiet pond. As I knelt before the water, I saw my reflection for the first time. My head was a blob of moss with a single glowing dot. Where it connected with the body was a tangle of interweaved moss and bloody flesh. Blood had dyed my shirt and cloak a dull red. A part of me recoiled at the sight. Another part embraced it, as if it were only natural.

It was at this moment that a young elven girl, wearing a long dandelion-colored dress and holding a basket of clothes, came to the pond. She looked up at me, saw the head made of a moss blob, and screamed. I too would have screamed at the sudden noise before I realized, I could not speak. The young elven girl had already scrambled away before I could react.

Realizing the unnaturalness of my moss blob head toward others, I headed back to pick up the raven mask, only to realize that there was already another humanoid in the clearing who had picked up the raven mask. Fearing another frightened encounter, I hid behind a tree. It was a young human girl with a similar head of curly black hair. She was dressed only in a torn dress. It occurred to me that she was poor, likely homeless. Where had this thought arisen from?

As I watched, she suddenly collapsed. A sudden burst of.. of... stress? Worry? Filled my chest. A light drizzle of rain covered the area, masking the silence which lay beneath. I could not leave her there, in the rain. She was so frail, her pale face in stark contrast with her black locks. With no destination in mind, face now covered by a mask, I picked up the little girl and trudged through the forest. The rain was falling harder now, pattering on the leaves, collecting in ditches and streams.

I found a small cave to hide in, and as I sat there, watching the gloomy skies, the young girl stirred behind me, pushing herself up with arms too thin.

"Nathaniel!" She yelled with excitement before leaping into my arms. "I thought you were dead!" She cried, voice muffled by the clothes, "What would I have done without you, brother?" I could only pat her gently on the back, unable to respond.

For the next couple days, we wandered through the forest together. She seemed to know that something had changed, yet was set on pretending that all was the same. Time passed quickly as she talked about anything and everything. I learned the names of the plants and flowers, to identify the bird calls, to recognize the tracks of wild animals and those of people. During our time together, I realized that I needed neither food nor sleep, while the young girl complained of hunger and pain and exhaustion.

One night, as we were resting by the fire, I watched her happily munch at a rabbit's leg. I wanted to smile. I was content. A warm and comforting feeling. But I could not smile. I had no face. I couldn't even speak. Wallowing in self-pity, I noticed the rustle of leaves and the silence of the forest far too late. The blank masked man descended from the trees, and in the same way that Nathaniel died, the little girl died as well. A smile still graced her pale face as she tumbled down.

Silence fell. It was not vultures who watched me now, but the face of an empty mask.

I heard a smile in the low menacing voice that emanated from beneath the mask: "Nathaniel... What were you thinking? Coming back to life and just frolicking around with an innocent girl? Tsk tsk. You should know better. Don't you think?" I stared at him. My silence must have confused him, for the voice which came after had lost its smile. "No matter, I'll just kill you again." He stalked towards me, blood dripping off his dagger. I gripped the cloak, feeling bits of fleece sink into my fingers.

"Why did you kill her?" The mysterious voice from earlier snarled. The blank masked man flinched, reflexively slashing his dagger at the area by his right ear. "Why did you kill her? Why did you kill Nathaniel?!" The mysterious voice repeated. Small motes of light sparkled in the firelight. It was the voice of my thoughts. My voice, magically created. An illusion of voice.

"Indeed, only a Minor Illusion, but real enough," the echoey voice responded in my head, quiet and steady.

"You're not Nathaniel. Who are you?" The masked man was cautious now, having lost some of the earlier bravado. "You're dressed exactly the same, with the bloodstains and all. That's Nathaniel, the one I stuck a dagger in. But you're not him, are you? You must be some monster who took over his corpse. No matter. Nathaniel is dead, and you will be too."

Self-preservation instincts kicked in. A discordant melody popped into my head, as if picking a soundtrack for the scene. It was a somber sort of chaos, as if the dead were wailing. The illusion voice hummed the melody as it played. At the sound, the blank masked man suddenly clutched his hands to his ears and stumbled away, no longer interested in killing me.

"The Dissonant Whispers of these lost souls are more powerful than one might think." The voice echoed in my head again. It needed a name. Perhaps... Glis.

I found the blank masked man writhing in pain in a nearby bush. I picked up his dagger, and with a satisfying smoothness, sunk it into the back of his neck. Just like Nathaniel. Like the young girl. I took his dagger and a small pouch of coins. There was nothing else of importance on his body except an emblem. \<INSERT HELLA COOL SYMBOL>

I left his body for the vultures as I buried the young girl, realizing that I had never learned her name. It was a couple days before I finally found a small town. A beaten down sign marked it as Reyfa (I can read?).

Principle: I have a soft place in my heart for the poor.

##### Arc 2: Reyfa

Reyfa was small but well-kept. Children played in the roads while the adults worked. The sounds of blacksmiths working echoed through the village. It was only after a couple days skulking around the outskirts of the village, observing and listening to the villagers speak, that I worked up the courage to enter.

The villagers weren't immediately hostile, merely watching me warily. The children ran to the side, watching me with unhidden curiosity. I found the inn with ease, as it was the largest building right at the center of the village. Beside the inn was a town board, detailing various events and advertisements (I _can_ read!). One in particular caught my eye. It was for the Vasara Adventuring Company, looking for new adventurers. Should I be interested, I could speak with the innkeeper.

Adventuring sounded like fun. Perhaps it could help me understand who I was, where I learned my magic from, who on earth Glis, the voice in my head, was. And of course, to fill in the blank void of my past with new experiences.

I headed into the inn and was greeted with desperate cries. The innkeeper was being pulled by his shirt over the counter by a robed man. The innkeeper was an half-elf with long brown hair tied behind him into a bun. Despite a lack of facial hair, creases lined his face, revealing his old age.

"I don't know anyone by the name of Nathaniel!" the innkeeper was yelling desperately. As I entered, he makes panicked eye contact with me. Distracted, the robed man turns around. He was wearing a mask, half of which was happy and smiling, while the other half was frowning, almost crying. On his robe, I notice the same symbol I saw on the blank-masked man's robe. Upon seeing me, he chuckles and drops the innkeeper, who sinks beneath the bar in fear.

"I was just looking for you, Nathaniel! And you just happened to show up, what a coincidence! I suppose the previous one wasn't successful, seeing as you're standing here, alive and well."

I scrunch up my robe, feeling the fleece, a surge of hot blood rushing to my head. The glitters appeared around me again. All I needed was the illusion of speaking.

"What do you want with Nathaniel?" The illusion voice growled. My voice. Strangely androgynous, though it made sense. The masked man tensed upon hearing the voice, stepping abruptly to the left.

"Speaking in third person? _And_ sparkles? _And_ magically right next to my ear? _Real dramatic_. Well, it's simple, really. You, Nathaniel, betrayed us. Loyalty is our greatest value, one doesn't simply betray us and walk away alive. You must be silenced. And once I'm done, I suppose I'll deal with the innkeeper too."

"What did Nathaniel do to constitute the deaths of so many innocent bystanders?" I ask. I'd started recognizing the voice as my own. Was it my voice from the past I never experienced?

"Seriously, what sort of question is this? And when will you stop projecting your voice to be right beside my ear? It's weird." The masked man complained. A slight tremor in his voice revealed his sudden doubts. His hand crept towards the dagger hanging at his right. "Here, I'll tell you. You'll be dead soon anyways. I'm sure you've heard of that museum which houses the relics from the rebellion. The ones which slew Duessel. West of the capital. Y'know, we'd planned a heist to rob it, but something irked Nathaniel about it. Maybe he thought it was sacriligeous, an affront to all those who died in battle against Duessel. Whatever the case, he spilled the details of the heist to the crowsguard, who then proceeded to swoop in during the heist and thwarted our efforts. Hell, they even captured one of our members. It was a grand shitshow. So now, he's got to go. He's forsaken our greatest value. But seriously though, why am I telling you the story of _your_ crimes??"

And as he stated this last word, he leapt at me, dagger outstretched.

"Not even close!" I yelled at him, sparkling even brighter. He flinched at the nonexistent presence by his right ear, confused and distracted by the fact that I had yelled this before he'd even swung bis dagger. By the time he'd gathered his wits, he had hesitated far too long. He missed, landing unsteadily behind me.

Glis chuckled in my head, a gentle sound. "A silver-tongued barb always does the trick."

"Will you stop doing that?" the masked man grumbled, "always speaking _in_ my ear."

Before he could do anything more, the whispers of the dead rose around me again. With a groan of pain, the masked man ran away from me towards the door, where he was promptly dealt with by a group of villagers who had heard the commotion.

As I walked over to check towards the innkeeper, he reflexively drew back from me. "I don't want anything to do with someone who attracts killers." He muttered.

"Relax," I illusioned as I sparkled, "I'm not Nathaniel, he mistook me as someone else."

"Well," the innkeeper said, still a little hesitant, "I suppose I do have to thank you for saving my life. If not for your timely entrance, I may not be alive anymore. Order anything, it'll be on the house."

I heard a muffled commotion from outside.

"Well, I actually came in to talk to you about that advertisement for the Vasara Adventuring Company. I'd like to join."

"Oh yeah? You aren't the only one from our village. Elzor, a small halfling, is interested as well. How about you stay here for the night and tomorrow morning, I'll introduce you guys and send you on your way?"

I nodded happily, too excited to formulate words.

That night, as I lay in my room, I wondered about who I used to be, about how I got my powers. Who was Glis, who always seemed to be narrating my magic? Why did I sparkle when I cast spells? My mind was blank. I knew nothing about this world. Who was Duessel? Perhaps I should try to find a library and learn more about this world's history. With these questions swirling around my head, I fell into a trance, and thus, passed the night.

##### Arc 3: Elzor

Bright and early the next morning, I went down to find Elzor and the innkeeper. The innkeeper was at the counter already, rubbing some sleepiness from his eyes. He smiled at me as I walked in.

"Good morning! I hope you slept well! Here, have some breakfast. Unless you just always have that mask on." A tray with a plate of eggs and toast, a glass of milk, and a jar of strawberry yogurt was placed before me. I didn't need food, but was it possible to eat regardless? I started with the strawberry yogurt, as it smelled _very_ nice. Somewhat hesitantly, I took a spoonful of yogurt and put it under my mask, somewhat under my eyeball. My moss blob glorped it up, consuming it into some little void that might've existed. I couldn't taste it, but I could smell it much more clearly. It was delicious. The jar was glorped clean.

"Can I keep the jar?" I asked the innkeeper, who had been watching me eat with amusement on his face.

"I don't see why not, you must really like strawberry yogurt."

Just then, a halfling breezed in, sporting a blonde mushroom cut. Two hand axes hung at his waist. This must be Elzor. He eagerly stole the toast from out of my tray, and while munching, he asked, "So, when are we leaving?"

The innkeeper sighed and said, "So this is Elzor, rude as ever. Elzor, this is..."

"Bloo, with two O's."

"Right, Bloo. He saved my life. Now, both of you want to join the Vasara Adventuring Guild, right? They're currently recruiting from around the countryside. Soon, someone from the Guild will come through and take you both with them."

"Alright!" said Elzor, continuing to steal my food without any hint of embarrassment.

After an hour of small talk and awkward silences, a female tiefling walked in. Her skin was a warm reddish brown, sharply accentuating her silver eyes. Her horns curled behind her ears, holding her brown hair away from her face. She strode straight towards the innkeeper, stating her purpose with no introduction.

"I got the signal. You have people who wish to join the Vasara Adventuring Guild?"

"Yeah, Bloo and Elzor," the innkeeper responded, gesturing to the two of us.

"Great, we're slightly short on time, I was just handed a mission, so we might as well see what these two are made of." Without another word, she strode towards the door. A split second of hesitation later, Elzor and I chased after her.

Together, the three of us traveled through the forest. The tiefling introduced herself as Viella, a veteran adventurer who'd been with the Vasara Adventuring Guild for quite a while. The mission that she had recently been assigned was to investigate the disappearance of a large amount of cows right at the edge of the forest. Apparently, a farmer's free-roaming cows had wandered into the forest and promptly disappeared. The farmer was certain that the cows had never walked into the forest before and didn't have a reason to either. Because of his loud complaining, what used to be a small problem became a larger one, and thus, Viella was sent to deal with it.

We arrived right at the edge of the forest to see a trampled mess among the bushes. It appeared that the cows had run for their lives into the forest, but it was unknown what was chasing them. After a couple minutes of following the cow's track, large footprints suddenly appeared among the mud. Its sudden and deep indentation indicated that whatever it was had jumped out of the trees. The footprint itself was curious, almost as if it was a large bull or horse, but _very large_.

The footprints continued deep into the forest, winding around trees that grew ever larger. Finally, deep into the dark forest, a small valley presented itself, with a large hole at its end. The tracks winded down into the hole, and the faint smell of rotting meat wafted out. All around the valley were the marks of a monster, from large chunks of trampled ground to large bones picked clean lying haphazardly around.

"Damn," whispered Viella, "Why has the problem become like this??"

As we were assessing the situation, a monster suddenly leapt down into the valley, perfectly blocking our way back. It was an incredibly agile minotaur. His muscles were lean yet strong, perfectly adapted for climbing trees and totally capable of killing.

Viella cursed, drawing her rapier. There was no way out. Behind us was his cave, where the smell of cow manure and death wafted from. Without any warning, the minotaur left at Viella. But she was prepared. Looking as if she was dancing, she dodged and parried the minotaur's attacks. Elzor roared, eager to join the battle. With her two hand axes out, she leapt onto the back of the minotaur and sunk her weapons into its back. The minotaur roared in pain, attempting to throw Elzor off. But Elzor hung on tightly.

Viella used the opportunity to slash at the minotaur again, causing a loud boom to echo around the clearing, before lightly jumping away. The minotaur was focused on hurling Elzor from his back, grabbing and scratching at his back. Elzor was hanging on for dear life, almost looking as if he regretted his decisions.

In an attempt to help Elzor out of his predicament, I called upon the whispers of the dead. Their voices swirled around me, whispering that somber yet chaotic melody. The minotaur flinched, but was able to overcome their cries. Turning his beady eyes at me, he charged. Just as he ran perhaps 5 feet, he was covered in some sort of vibrating magic, and a loud thunderous boom echoed once again around the clearing. He stumbled, his arms and legs trembling from the thunder.

Elzor was rattled from the blast, and yet continued to stay upon his back. He started hacking away at the minotaur's back, sinking his axes deeper and deeper into its flesh. The minotaur roared, shaking the very ground. Much as how one might perform a suplex (What is a suplex? Why do I know these things?), the minotaur smashes Elzor into the ground. I flinch at the muffled crunch of Elzor's bones.

Viella didn't miss a beat. She leapt upwards, hurling a bright orb of energy at the minotaur's exposed stomach. On impact, it steamed through the minotaur's flesh. The acrid smell of burning flesh permeated the air, barely covering the smell of cow manure and death. Following that, Viella fell from the sky, attempting to slash at his stomach. But the minotaur recovered quickly, leaping away to safety. Viella only barely managed to avoid slashing at Elzor, who was lying crumpled up in a small crater.

"Get him to safety!" Viella yells at me, before promptly engaging the minotaur in another furious engagement. I ran to pull Elzor out from the crater. He had a couple broken ribs but was otherwise alive, from what I could tell. Suddenly, I heard a panicked yell, and as I looked up, the minotaur was leaping at Elzor and I.

Without so much as flinching, I whispered at the minotaur, "Not even close...". I felt the sparkles around me. The minotaur slipped, just barely missing Elzor and I with his attack. Glis sighed in relief in my head. Viella leapt by, continuing her barrage of attacks. Looking at what the minotaur had done to Elzor, who was lying unresponsive in my arms, I felt a well of anger from within me. I glared at the minotaur, and hissed "angery" at him. I felt a strange feeling, as if I had pierced through the minotaur's skull with my mind. The minotaur flinched, leaving an opening for Viella.

"Oh how weak one's mind can be..." whispered Glis. Viella slashed at the minotaur's neck, successfully severing about half of his neck. The minotaur let out a low groan before collapsing, blood pouring out of his wound into the ground.

"Not bad not bad," Viella said, turning to me, "you have some potential. Come on, take that unconscious kid and let's head to a hospital."

With a little spark of happiness, I carried Elzor upon my back and followed behind Viella as she strode off.

##### Arc 4: Ghosts of the Past

After Elzor and I defeated the minotaur, Viella recruited us into the Vasara Adventuring Guild. For the next 2 years, we adventured together. We delivered packages through goblin-infested caves, killed demonic chickens during the demonic chicken plague of 308, helped towns stave off invasions from gelatinous cubes, and stopped bandits before they could wreck havoc on the innocent lives. Together, we wandered from the forests of Fusilla to the militant empire of Dagdra to the island nations of the Hyritian Alliance. It was in Margavelle however, where Nathaniel's past caught up to me.

Our next mission had taken us to Relfor, the capital city of Margavelle. We were tasked with killing some witches which had infested a patch of forest near Relfor, and had arrived a day early to scout out the situation. I was still clothed in my usual garb, a cloak with the hood over my head along with a crow mask. In the span of 2 years, Elzor had never found out that I was a blob and not a human. Though he questioned my wardrobe choices, he had gotten used to it. Elzor was excitedly looking at the various food stands, trying to pick out something to buy with his limited funds, when I almost ran into two robed figures. I immediately recognized the emblem on their robes, it was the same emblem as the one on the blank masked man back in Reyfa. The two robed figures made eye contact, and with a surprising amount of unplanned coordination, pulled me into a nearby shady alley.

"You have a lot of nerve coming here, Nathaniel," one of the robed figures said in a low yet feminine voice, "I'm surprised you even dare walk around in public like that. You know, there's a decent bounty on your head right now within the guild, right?" This was the first time I'd heard of a bounty on my head. However, I'd been lucky and had never met anyone from the guild before this. Perhaps it was now that my luck ran out.

##### Things I Made Up:

**Glis** - Voice in my head

**Nathaniel** - Died immediately, where the raven mask comes from, remind me of my origins, curly black hair, human male
**Nathaniel's Sister** - unnamed, also died as collateral damage mostly, young human girl, curly black hair
**Blank Masked Man** - unnamed, I killed him, part of the League of Larcenists, killed Nathaniel + sis
**Reyfa Innkeeper** - male half-elf, long brown hair in a man bun
**Elzor** - male halfling, blond hair, mushroom-style cut, wants to join vasara, barbarian?
**Viella** - female tiefling, warm reddish brown skin, silver eyes, horns, brown hair, Bladesinger - Booming Blade - Chromatic Orb

**Reyfa** - a small town in the forests of Fusilla, west of the lake

##### Timeline because God I'm Out of Time

Year 309 - switches corpses because Nathaniel's past caught up, but keeps the crow mask and the strawberry yogurt jar, joins Vasara again
Year 314 - Damian IV coronated
Year 319 - been in same corpse for 10 years, sort of stagnated in terms of learning, got that depresso espresso numb mode on, but  meets a human who looks a shit ton like Nathaniel's sister (to be named later), who helps instill a sense of my good principles (will be detailed later), we go adventuring together
Year 321 - the girl dies, and hence another principle is internalized
Year 322 - I switch corpses, because this one reminds me too much of the girl, I switch to a kenku and stay until I meet with the DnD group
Year 331 - Certain events (to be figured out later) during adventuring help me walk out of grief, but I stop adventuring for awhile and settle, just reading books and gardening and generally chilling in a city (to be figured out later) in Fusilla
Year 345 - I start adventuring again, realizing I need to learn more about Glis and figure out my powers and past
Year 347 (now) - IDK how I meet the party

##### Notes:

I have 40 years worth of memories, a bit before Damian IV's coronation
Year 347 rn
Year 307 memories start
He was coronated Year 314
but I will say you have existed for some unknown number of years before blob
and your blob will know that it's existed before the amnesia
