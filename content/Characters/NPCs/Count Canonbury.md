# Count Canonbury

The Dead Count

An elf who was once a student of the magic academy trying to become a legendary inventor. He attempted to replicate the [[Miscellaneous/The Mirror of Enveloping Darkness]] without the bad side effects and says that the other side of his mirror is a person's own mindscape. Turns out it was portal to somewhere that projected the mindscape. He worked as a scientist for [[Characters/NPCs/The Order of the Fish]] and had been researching people coming into the Material Plane from the Fae Wild through [[Miscellaneous/The Count's Orb\|the orb]]. The count was investigating the various portals that are popping up everywhere due to the [[History of Faltera/271 CE - The Interplanar Expansion\|interplanar expansion]].

According to the fairies found at Count Canonbury's Manor, people have been entering the Fae Wild for decades ([[Session Notes - Reflections/06 - 1.25.2024 - The Count's Balls#^a46d2e\|here]]). The Count was becoming more paranoid and distrustful as his research went on.

He was suspicious of [[Characters/PCs/Yul]], [[Characters/PCs/Nim]], and [[Characters/PCs/Bloo]] during their encounter ([[Session Notes - Reflections/06 - 1.25.2024 - The Count's Balls#^2f57c6\|here]]). He knows that Bloo is a blob and wants to rectify its entire existence, believing Bloo to be a smudge on history,

The party stole his balls.

He mentions that he needs to meet up with the other bearers of the [[Miscellaneous/The Fish Crystals\|fish]] that was found in his bedroom.

[[Characters/NPCs/Seliph Orsterra]] discovers that the Count had contacted both [[Characters/NPCs/Astrid von Novis]] and her apprentice [[Characters/NPCs/Horace Frostdir]] for funds. He failed magic school at the University of Southern Canonbury. He pretended to be a professional warmage but it fell apart when it was figured out he was using an eldritch cannon.
