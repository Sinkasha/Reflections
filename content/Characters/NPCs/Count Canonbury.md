# Count Canonbury
The Dead Count

An elf who was once a student of the magic academy trying to become a legendary inventor. He attempted to replicate the [[The Mirror of Enveloping Darkness]] without the bad side effects and says that the other side of his mirror is a person's own mindscape. Turns out it was portal to somewhere that projected the mindscape. He worked as a scientist for [[The Order of the Fish]] and had been researching people coming into the Material Plane from the Fae Wild through [[The Count's Orb|the orb]]. The count was investigating the various portals that are popping up everywhere due to the [[271 CE - The Interplanar Expansion|interplanar expansion]]. 

According to the fairies found at Count Canonbury's Manor, people have been entering the Fae Wild for decades ([[06 - 1.25.2024 - The Count's Balls#^a46d2e|here]]). The Count was becoming more paranoid and distrustful as his research went on. 

He was suspicious of [[Yul]], [[Nim]], and [[Bloo]] during their encounter ([[06 - 1.25.2024 - The Count's Balls#^2f57c6|here]]). He knows that Bloo is a blob and wants to rectify its entire existence, believing Bloo to be a smudge on history, 

The party stole his balls. 

He mentions that he needs to meet up with the other bearers of the [[The Fish Crystals|fish]] that was found in his bedroom. 

[[Seliph Orsterra]] discovers that the Count had contacted both [[Astrid von Novis]] and her apprentice [[Horace Frostdir]] for funds. He failed magic school at the University of Southern Canonbury. He pretended to be a professional warmage but it fell apart when it was figured out he was using an eldritch cannon.
