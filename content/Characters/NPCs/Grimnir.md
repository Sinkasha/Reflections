# Grimnir

Spoopy mage

A wickedly powerful mage who eliminates all those who cross him. One of the only travelers to [[Faltera/Dagdra/The Empire of Dagdra#Thalanrod\|Thalanrod, Dagdra]].

Theories abound that he might be behind the auras around the world and by extension the disappearances. He is [[Characters/NPCs/Theodore]]'s master.
