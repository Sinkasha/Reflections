# Jeice
[[Count Canonbury]]'s Adopted Son

A human warlock who failed magic school. 

Jeice attacked the party on their way from Ashfall to Parli [[09 - 4.04.2024 - The Consequences of Our Actions#COMBAT?|here]]. He was looking to return what the party stole from him, [[The Fish Crystals]]. 

He owns an interesting gauntlet which has 3 gem slots. It can save spells on itself for later casting, such as Counterspell and a teleportation spell. The stones are pre-infused with magic. This gauntlet was created by the Count which amplifies Jeice's magic. According to [[Horace Frostdir]], his patron is more powerful than [[The Order of the Fish]] and worships [[Religion of Faltera#God of Death Nyarlathotep|Nyarlathotep]]. 

He is capable of causing all [[The Fish Crystals]] to flash. 

Jeice got pissed at [[Drake]] and used him as a sacrifice to summon Hades. Using his gauntlet, he drained Drake of life and summoned Hades. He states that nobody will interrupt [[Theodore]]'s ritual. What this ritual is is unknown. Jeice created a small pocket dimension when summoning Hades, which was broken by [[Lyra]] and [[Yul]]'s collective efforts with the magic taught to them by [[Astrid von Novis]]. 

Part of [[The Order of the Fish]] and a [[Religion of Faltera#God of Death Nyarlathotep|Nyarlathotep]] follower.
