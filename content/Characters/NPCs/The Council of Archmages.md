# The Council of Archmages

Formed in 215 CE. Known to be secretive. 

The Council has created various temples at: 
- [[The Empire of Dagdra#Crescent Grove|Crescent Grove]] where [[Nim]] freed [[Yul]]
- Frostwind, Northwestern Fusilla 
- [[The Kingdom of Fusilla#Ridgepeak|Ridgepeak]], Northeastern Fusilla
- Nested Grove, near [[The Empire of Dagdra#Windrest|Windrest]]
These temples have different uses, and their locations are known by Nim due to her scholarly background. Crescent Grove is one of the many shrines that the Council created to hide the shards of [[The Mirror of Enveloping Darkness]]. Not all the shards were hidden in people. The Council does not like this and wishes that Nim not spread this information.
