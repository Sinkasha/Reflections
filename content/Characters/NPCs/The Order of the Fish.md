# The Order of the Fish

The Order is a political faction based in [[The Empire of Dagdra#Windrest|Windrest]]. Their goal is to overthrow the Queen of [[The Kingdom of Fusilla|Fusilla]]. 

[[Hugo Starling]] believes that the Order is a purely political operation that hires the [[The League of Larcenists]] *or* the League is a front for a particular wing of the Order. The Order blames Fusilla for the [[313 CE - The Assassination of the Dagdran Emperor Damian von Beryth III|assassination of Emperor Beryth III]], however, it was actually the Order who assassinated the Emperor as an inside job. The Order used this as an excuse after [[214 CE - The Subjugation of Duessel Sarde|Duessel was subjugated]] and [[215 CE - Dagdra Negotiates Independence; The Coronation of Emperor Damian von Beryth I|Dagdra became independent]] to achieve their goal of Dagdra conquering the rest of the continent. 

Related to [[The Fish Crystals]]. Not all members of the Order follow [[Religion of Faltera#God of Death Nyarlathotep|Nyarlathotep]], and the Nyarlathotep followers are using the Order.  Nyarlathotep followers' and the Order's goals sort of align. [[The League of Larcenists]] is a nonlethal branch of the Order. They are a distraction. 

The upper ranks of the Order all have markings on their face.
