# Theodore
Unknown Member of the [[Characters/NPCs/The Order of the Fish]]

Apparently [[Characters/NPCs/Mikhail]] takes orders from him. He told Mikhail to "retrieve all remaining crystals in the pedestal, the ritual should not be initiated until further notice". 

Is a disciple of [[Characters/NPCs/Grimnir]]. Was killed [[Session Notes - Reflections/16 - 06.07.2024 - The Big Boss#^9e06d4\|here]] supposedly, but turns out it was a puppet similar to [[Characters/PCs/Yul]] and it also contained a shard of [[Miscellaneous/The Mirror of Enveloping Darkness]]. 

His head is currently in Yul's possession
