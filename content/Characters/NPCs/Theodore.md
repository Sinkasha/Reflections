# Theodore
Unknown Member of the [[The Order of the Fish]]

Apparently [[Mikhail]] takes orders from him. He told Mikhail to "retrieve all remaining crystals in the pedestal, the ritual should not be initiated until further notice". 

Is a disciple of [[Grimnir]]. Was killed [[16 - 06.07.2024 - The Big Boss#^9e06d4|here]] supposedly, but turns out it was a puppet similar to [[Yul]] and it also contained a shard of [[The Mirror of Enveloping Darkness]]. 

His head is currently in Yul's possession
