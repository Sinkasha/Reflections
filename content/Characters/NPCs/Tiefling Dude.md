He was the bearer of the yellow [[Miscellaneous/The Fish Crystals\|fish crystal]].

This tiefling is part of the upper ranks in [[Characters/NPCs/The Order of the Fish]]. They were seen wearing formal aristocratic wear with a shoulder cape. Black and red undertones. He was holding a long long [[Miscellaneous/Space-Time Swords\|sword]] that was capable of dealing magical slashing damage from a far distance. Using Detect Magic, Conjuration magic can be felt from the sword. Dispel Magic does not work against the sword, it feels as if the sword has some anti-magic property to it that is warding it against magical attacks. This sword is capable of opening rifts and allowing the tiefling to teleport around the Material Plane.

The tiefling believes that [[Religion of Faltera#Nyarlathotep\|Nyarlathotep]] is still with us.

He was sent to clean up after [[Characters/NPCs/Jeice]] and [[Characters/NPCs/Petra von Alspar]]'s mess. He killed the three goblins who were attempting to coerce money out of [[Characters/NPCs/Derrick Fiskov]] and who stole the [[Miscellaneous/Silver Key with Fusillan Flag\|Silver key]].

He appears to know what [[Characters/PCs/Yul]] is. He tells Yul, "I know you're in there, now come with me and we can make this easy." He then asks to meet Yul at Lake Novis. He calls Yul a puppet.

He is immune to psychic damage. He is resistant to lightning damage.
