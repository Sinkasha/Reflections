# Violet
Drow Elf

Mother of [[Allie]]. Still alive. Likely in [[The Kingdom of Fusilla#Geimshall Woods|Geimshall Woods]]. Apparently visited [[Bloo]] in the past but Bloo does not remember. Is related to the sanctuary in the Geimshall Woods. Was walking into the sanctuary as Bloo was leaving. Knows more than she lets on. Violet knew who Bloo was and concealed it from Astrid for some reason. 

Violet was the drow elf who shot the arrow at [[Duessel Sarde]].
