# Bloo
Sherri's Blob Sorcerer

Bloo woke up near the Geimshall Woods in [[Faltera/Fusilla/The Kingdom of Fusilla\|Fusilla]]. After the repeated mentioning of [[Characters/NPCs/Duessel Sarde]], Bloo feels a strong familiarity towards him, but a negative one. Bloo gets the feeling that they have met Duessel before they became Bloo. Bloo also gets the feeling that they have been to [[Faltera/Fusilla/The Kingdom of Fusilla#Parli\|Parli]] before becoming Bloo. 

Using Detect Magic, one can sense multiple types of magic, including illusion and necromancy magic, concentrated around its head. 

Bloo's true name is Sorean, wielder of Dynamo. Bloo killed Duessel Sarde during [[History of Faltera/214 CE - The Subjugation of Duessel Sarde]]. In the Geimshall Woods, Violet was also at the sanctum that Bloo was leaving, likely when recently blob-ified. 

Bloo's yogurt business, Strawgurt, is sponsored by Duke Corven von Aquarion, [[Faltera/Fusilla/The Kingdom of Fusilla\|Fusilla]]'s grand treasurer, as Fusilla's official dessert. Bloo will now gain passive income that can be cashed in upon returning to Parli. The rate is 1d4 x 10 gold per day. 

Sorean was Roland Vasara's (founder of [[Guilds/Vasara Adventuring Company]]) older brother. It was Sorean's dream to found the VAC so Roland founded it in his name. Roland never stopped looking for Sorean, believing him to be alive.
