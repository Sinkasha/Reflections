# Yul

Rachel's Tiefling Cleric, AKA Banana

A banana.
Freed by [[Characters/PCs/Nim]] at [[Faltera/Dagdra/The Empire of Dagdra#Crescent Grove\|Crescent Grove]]. Originally sealed by [[Characters/NPCs/The Council of Archmages]].

She gains her powers from [[Religion of Faltera#God of Life Yddris\|Yddris]]. Apparently her blood is poisonous.

According to [[Characters/NPCs/Count Canonbury]], Yul was sealed in the ruins and is possibly a cursed blood puppet ([[Session Notes - Reflections/06 - 1.25.2024 - The Count's Balls#^45371e\|here]]). Her blood is poisonous

Using Detect Magic, one can detect faint Necromancy magic around the core of her body. She is not undead. Using Identify, one notices that there are no active spells affecting Yul, but she has a magical core that is not active but has traces of necromancy magic on it. Apparently it is supplementing the heart. Can feel some evil from her magical core.

Removing or destroying the orb inside Yul may not be as easy as it seems. [[Characters/NPCs/Horace Frostdir]] confirms it to be a shard of [[Miscellaneous/The Mirror of Enveloping Darkness]] inside Yul. Yul voluntarily accepted the shard and agreed to be sealed away. Yul was constructed for this purpose. She was created in the likeness of her creator.

During her encounter with [[Characters/NPCs/Tiefling Dude]], she emitted a dark flash of light from the orb in her chest, which may be a flash of the Shadowfell. Voices in her head told her to "return to your original form" along with a strong pulsating feeling in her chest as well as sharp and intense pain.

Yul was specifically designed to contain the shards and extract their powers. They are safe within Yul and she gets more powerful with more shards. Yul lacks a brain and some other organs, she is artificially constructed so inside of her is a cavity but she does have a heart. She has a cavity in her chest which stores the original shard and when you put another shard in it creates another little glass orb thing.
