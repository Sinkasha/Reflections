# Crescent Grove

[[Nim]] unsealed [[Yul]] here. Yul's sealing here appears to be voluntary. Yul was in a crystal bubble in suspended animation, which looked to contain Yul (may be the spell Sequester). The temple here was created by [[The Council of Archmages]] and appears to be used to seal away something very powerful, Yul. When Nim broke the seal, the seal was already almost at its time limit. The seal had iconography from the Council on it. The ruins are about 130 year old, placing its creation around the year 217 CE, about 2 years after the death of [[Duessel Sarde]].
