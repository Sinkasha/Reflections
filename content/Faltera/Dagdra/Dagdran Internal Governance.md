# Dagdran Internal Governance
The Emperor, the Legions, and the Ministers have monthly council meetings discussing the state of the Empire. These are not necessarily meant to be policy meetings, although that may happen during these should the need arise. 

**The Prime Minister** is the leader of the Ministers, highly influential lords of the Empire. The Prime Minister is tasked with keeping the other lords in check, and is the only minister position to be appointed by the Emperor. The Emperor will appoint one of the existing ministers to be Prime Minister, after which they will choose one of their heirs to replace them. The Prime Minister is a major public figurehead, whose duties involve managing internal affairs that fall beyond the Emperor.

**The General of the Dagdran Army** has few roles outside of being the leading commander of the largest military in the realm. The General is in charge of training all the Lieutenants and Commanding Officers, and creates an orderly regimen and acts as a leader in times of war.

**The Minister of Foreign Affairs** is a diplomat that often visits embassies in other nations to keep the peace and negotiate agreements. They are often away on trips for weeks to months on end, however they are present for all major discussions when summoned. They are the primary foreign representative of Dagdra.

**The Minister of Domestic Affairs** is in charge of proposing laws and maintaining internal peace and prosperity. They usually stick to their demesne and the capital city, and deal with keeping order through domestic policy.

**The Minister of Religion** is in charge of maintaining the Church and the teachings of the gods. The gods of highest regard are the God of War, the [[Religion of Faltera#God of the Sun Clarus|God of the Sun]], the God of the Forge, and the God of Truth. There is little religious discrimination, however the Minister of Religion generally keeps the teachings standardized. This is the least influential position among the ministers as religion is comparatively not as important in the Empire.

**The Minister of Medicine** …

**The Minister of Commerce** runs the treasury and is in charge of maintaining trade. The Minister of Commerce sees to it that the economy remains stable and that the taxation of the common folk and lords alike remain fair.

**The Legions** are the Emperor’s trusted council of advisors, although the Emperor of Dagdra always gets the final word. The Legions have high influence, as they are the Emperor’s most trusted confidants. They attend every significant meeting that involves both domestic and foreign affairs, and have the respect of the Ministers. The Legions are hand-selected by the Emperor themselves, and are appointed that position until either the Emperor abdicates or dies. The duty of the Legions is to provide council and additional voices to sway the Emperor in the correct direction. They do little in the eye of the public, as their duties are all internal to the bureaucracy.
