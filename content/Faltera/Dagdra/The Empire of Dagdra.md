Dagdra is an extremely strong military power, very prominent in the world since its inception. Having existed for 500 years with little border changes other than expansions, none dare attack Dagdra. Those who have Dagdra as an ally are kept very reassured as Dagdra holds their alliances to a high degree of respect, always aiding allies in their time of need. Being on bad terms with a Dagdran official usually bodes quite terribly. In general, the people of Dagdra are somewhat well off. Poverty exists and there is a fair bit of crime, however the nation is kept quite orderly, brutally suppressing any insurrections by the roots at the first signs of treason. The people of Dagdra are proud and generally supportive of the Emperor, though there exist a few who criticize his role as an autocrat, though these are mostly those who are accustomed to the ways of Fusilla, the neighboring country.

The royal family of Dagdra is still recovering from the [[History of Faltera/313 CE - The Assassination of the Dagdran Emperor Damian von Beryth III\|assassination of the previous emperor]].
