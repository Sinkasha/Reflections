# Canonbury

A city with a relatively normal settlement on the ground but with a vast network of tunnels and underground rooms and structures within the mountain. Home to a bustling night market for each season with various exports and very expensive things. The city houses a large population. The mineshafts within the mountain is mostly for coal mining. One can reach [[Faltera/Fusilla/The Kingdom of Fusilla#Parli\|Parli]] by going straight through the mountain path.
