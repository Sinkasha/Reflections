# Everholden

North of Parli. Hugo got the orange [[Miscellaneous/The Fish Crystals\|fish crystal]] here.
As per the laws of Everholden, all travelers require a shepherd to accompany them outside of the city to explore the ruins and whatnot because it is so dangerous. Has a tavern named Bottomless Mugs in the basement of the VAC + Military Barrack.
