# Fusillan Internal Governance

**The Ruling Monarch** has the highest authority, and can veto or execute any law as seen fit. There are internal policies and regulations regarding the frequency the Monarch can abuse this power, but given the teachings of Fusilla, this hardly goes overused, at least in the eyes of the people. The Monarch receives suggestions for laws by the Parliamentary Regent. The Monarch also acts as the head of the Fusillan Military.

**The Prime Minister** …

**The Parliamentary Regent** is the head of the democratic house of Fusilla, known as the Peoples’ Chamber. Their primary job is to facilitate discussions and come to consensus, then report to the Monarch. They have moderate influence, but are primarily a private figure.

**The Grand Treasurer** oversees the economics of Fusilla. Their authority lies in the centralized nature of the Fusillan economy, and they get to regulate and collect taxes on the land. The Grand Treasurer is the highest in command when it comes to business practices, obtaining various merchant licenses, as well as the regulation of importation and exportation. All items deemed legal and illegal go through the Grand Treasurer.

**The Chancellor of Education** is responsible for formulating the magical curriculum at the top magical institutions in Fusilla. They communicate with the Luminary about magical breakthroughs and discuss means of implementing spells, magical items, curses, arcana, and the history of magic in meaningful ways.

**The Luminary** is the title bestowed upon the court mage of the Kingdom, the strongest mage in the country. The Luminary is tasked with leading progress into magical research of all fields, including curses and magical items with the intent of pushing the boundaries of magic. 

**The Royal Ambassador** is the official foreign diplomat of Fusilla. They often spend time as a representative in foreign nations, and as a result are rarely in Fusilla proper. They are regarded quite highly in other nations, even those that don’t necessarily view Fusilla positively.
