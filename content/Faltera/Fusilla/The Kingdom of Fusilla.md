Fusilla has a formidable global presence in Faltera. Being at the forefront of diplomacy across the region, Fusilla is known for its widespread influence. While primarily focusing on diplomacy with promises for prosperity, the Kingdom is the oldest still-standing country (established in 1 CE), and as such, is known for its incredible defensive military prowess, though the nation doesnâ€™t shy from force when the nobles deem necessary. Fusilla also attracts visitors and immigrants alike with their array of prestigious magic academies, including the famous Jaldenne Academy, home of the finest mages.
