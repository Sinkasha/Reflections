# Celestial Peak, Valzelia

Capital of the Hyritian Alliance. Epicenter of interplanar expansion. According to [[Characters/NPCs/Seliph Orsterra]] [[Session Notes - Reflections/07 - 2.6.2024 - The Count Dies, Goodbye Bugbear, Hello Sarah#^7803b7\|here]] there are many connections to the Faewild and rifts and Fae creatures at Celestial Peak. Luckily they are mostly docile.
