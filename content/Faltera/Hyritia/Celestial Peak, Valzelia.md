# Celestial Peak, Valzelia

Capital of the Hyritian Alliance. Epicenter of interplanar expansion. According to [[Seliph Orsterra]] [[07 - 2.6.2024 - The Count Dies, Goodbye Bugbear, Hello Sarah#^7803b7|here]] there are many connections to the Faewild and rifts and Fae creatures at Celestial Peak. Luckily they are mostly docile.
