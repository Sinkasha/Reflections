# Hyritian Internal Governance

**Head Chair**
The Head Chair is simply the leader of the chairs, and can overrule the judgment of the other two. Annually, the people of the Alliance come together to vote on the new Head Chair, whose term will be a single year in the elevated position. A Chair can be Head Chair for as many years as they are voted into the position for.

**Chairs**
The Chairs represent each of the main islands and are democratically elected to represent the people of the Hyritian Alliance. Chairs hold 10 year terms and can run up to 3 times. That is, if they run 3 times yet lose every time, they are barred from running again. Thus, the maximum length of power of any given Chair is 30 years. These three become the heads of the government, forming laws and meeting regularly to discuss the state of the Alliance.

**Inquisitors**
Each of the main islands has an Inquisitor which effectively is the enforcer of the law. As each of the separate islands is run slightly differently, each with slightly different laws. The matter in which the laws are enforced is at the discretion of each Inquisitor. They hold their position for 20 years max but can only hold the position once. They may abdicate sooner than their term.
