The Hyritian Alliance is a longstanding nation consisting of three primary islands in the archipelago. Valzelia is the largest and most influential, as well as the first island settled on. Wovram is the central island and is a cultural and travel hub within the Alliance. Dragale is the smallest of the three main islands but is home to several crystal mines.

Each island is sovereign, however, the Hyritian Alliance is treated internationally as single country. Some islands are more powerful or more influential.

Every election cycle, the head chair is voted on, and one can be the head chair until they are kicked out of their island chair. Each island operates slightly differently, with different laws and each with their own inquisitor.
