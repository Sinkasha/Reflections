# Margavellan Internal Governance

**The High Council** consists of the five main lords of the oligarchy. Ultimately, decisions are made by these five during these bimonthly meetings. Position, however, does matter in the end, as not all seats are created equal. 

**The Archduke** is the primary figurehead of the Duchy. Their responsibilities include being a public figure, delegating tasks to enforce the law, taxes, and property distribution. Additionally, they count as 6 votes in the High Council. 

**The Prime Minister** is in charge of domestic affairs within the Duchy. They are tasked with maintaining social order within the Duchy, as well as the cultural heritage and military of the nation. They are delegated 3 votes in the High Council.

**The Chancellor** deals with all things trade and foreign policy within the Duchy. They set tariffs, taxes, and enact foreign policies as well as behave as a diplomat. They are worth 5 votes in the High Council. 

**The President** is hand selected by the Archduke themselves. The President is the only title in the High Council that is not hereditary, and as such has a term limit - when the Archduke dies or abdicates. Theyâ€™re tasked with filling any supplemental roles within the government and as a result is the most vague yet flexible role. They count as 4 votes in the High Council.

**The Lawspeaker** is the enforcer of justice in the Duchy. They are the primary proposer of laws and oversee the courts. They are the final say in any court of law. They are worth 3 votes in the High Council.
