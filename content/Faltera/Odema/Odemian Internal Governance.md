# Odemian Internal Governance

**Hierophant**:
The supreme law of the Holy State, the Hierophant listens to the words of the [[Religion of Faltera#Celestial Gods\|Celestial Gods]], the Sun, Moon, and Stars. Their decree rules the entirety of the Holy State, as the words of the gods are seen as absolute, thus the holy messenger is entrusted to relay those words. By far, all of the political power in the Holy State rests in the hands of the Hierophant.

**Archbishop**:

While very distant to the Hierophant in terms of the power structure of the Holy State, the Archbishop is still the second most powerful person in Odema. The head of the Bishops, the Archbishop is tasked with maintaining religious order domestically, as well as spreading the word of the Cosmic Gods, who are seen as the Progenitors in the Odemian religion.
