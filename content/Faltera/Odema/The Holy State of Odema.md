The Holy State of Odema is a wealthy country which exports gold, most of which is used in currency around Faltera. Odema has a longstanding positive relationship with [[The Empire of Dagdra|Dagdra]], even from the early days of the revolution. As a result, [[The Kingdom of Fusilla|Fusilla]] sees Odema as an overly-religious thorn in Falteraâ€™s side, however the leverage Odema has over gold could destroy economies worldwide, so nations are forced to play nice.

Currently people of the Holy State of Odema primarily worship the gods of [[Religion of Faltera#God of the Sun Clarus|Sun]], [[Religion of Faltera#God of Fortune Aurus|Fortune]], and [[Religion of Faltera#God of Order Lucht|Order]].
