# Assal Artisans Guild

Headmaster: Parrago Alexestria

Chefs, artists, stonemasons, and all others who perfect an artisan craft are welcomed by the Assal Artisans Guild, the largest Artisans Guild in Faltera. Based in [[Faltera/Fusilla/The Kingdom of Fusilla#Assal\|Assal, Fusilla]]. Crafting and cooking recipes and techniques are taught at the schools sponsored by the AAG. This Artisans’ Guild also posts commissions and requests from across all of Faltera, especially for esteemed high class members of society. The level of entry is very high, however.
