# Brecht Performerâ€™s Union

President: Francois Plowright (famous singer)

The largest, most prestigious union of performers in Faltera employs and protects the rights of all who belong to it. While the union itself is open to members of all backgrounds, there is a social class system within the union. None get explicit preferential treatment per se, but there are some perks to being more famous and well known amongst your peers.
