# Halpyrâ€™s Adventurers

Leader: [[Characters/NPCs/Melina Fiskov]] (long-time adventurer)

One of the two major Adventurer's Guilds in Faltera, based in [[Faltera/Dagdra/Halpyr\|Halpyr, Dagdra]]. This guild is known for having an internal structure that mirrors a meritocracy. Adventurers are given a rating at the end of each moon and their rank determines their influence.
