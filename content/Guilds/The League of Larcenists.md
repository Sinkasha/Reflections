# The League of Larcenists

Leaders unknown

A nonlethal branch of [[Characters/NPCs/The Order of the Fish\|the Order]].

The largest Thieves’ Guilds in Faltera, the League of Larcenists is a powerful criminal syndicate with no known formal base of operations. Members from all countries are welcome, so long as you remain loyal to the cause. Membership into the League is unknown, as are their exact numbers and whereabouts, but it is assumed that recruitment is a hand-selected process. None of the five countries have been able to quash this group, and their heists have been spread far and wide, and are feared. Their motivations are unknown, though their “leaders” if there are any are rumored to be merely kleptomaniacs. What is known is that loyalty is valued above all else.

The League has a strict no killing policy.

Motto: "We steal but we do not kill, we do what's right for the world."

There are rumors ([[Session Notes - Reflections/09 - 4.04.2024 - The Consequences of Our Actions#^13958c\|here]]) that the League is going to to target [[Faltera/Fusilla/The Kingdom of Fusilla#Parli\|Parli]].
