## 212 CE - [[The Mirror of Enveloping Darkness]] is created in [[The Holy State of Odema|Odema]]

Two mysterious mages allegedly working for the Odemian government created a wicked relic of immense power. The mirror reveals to the beholder the worst traits in them, and magnifies it. This manifests in the beholder if they lack the resolve to fight off the temptation. If the beholder of the mirror can resist, they are granted total control over psychic and necrotic abilities.
