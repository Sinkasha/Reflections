# 213 CE - The Falteran Massacre

At the end of 213 CE, [[Characters/NPCs/Duessel Sarde]] erupts into a rage in [[Faltera/Dagdra/Thalanrod]] (modern day Dagdra) and runs headfirst into battle. The Fusillan Army tries their best to slay him, but no attacks - martial or magical - appear to even phase him. What can only be described as pure demonic wrath, Duessel earned the nickname “Shadebringer” when he single-handedly massacred the Fusillan Vanguard, which consisted of over 500 foot soldiers, 200 cavalrymen, and 50 highly skilled mages, in a single dark explosion that was described as “a void of death” by the few eyewitnesses that lived to tell the tale. This is where Thalanrod earned the nickname “The Overdark.”

This dark explosion was likely a breach of the Shadowfell.
