# 215 CE - [[Characters/NPCs/The Council of Archmages]] is Formed

Fearing another incident with the [[Miscellaneous/The Mirror of Enveloping Darkness\|Mirror]], the relic was carefully destroyed. Its shards were separated, though the exact whereabouts are only known by those present at its destruction. An international summit then was held, and it was decided that there needed to be an organization to help prevent another catastrophe. Thus, the Council of Archmages was formed. Each nation sends some of their most powerful mages to serve as both diplomats and limit testers for magic, and they attempt to keep the balance. While this is supposed to be a neutral third party, independent of the governments, Fusillaâ€™s Luminary is traditionally sent as one of the representatives. The Council is also ordained to have an equal number of representatives from each nation, in order to assist with impartiality.
