## 271 CE - The Interplanar Expansion

Odd geological and planar behaviors begin occurring in various corners of the world. [[The Hyritian Alliance#Celestial Peak|Celestial Peak, Valzelia]] is the first to have one such wave of oddities. The mountain begins to glow and magical auras begin permeating the landscape. Similar events occur in the Ylizian Forest in Dagdra, Geimshall Woods in Fusilla, and the tunnels around [[The Holy State of Odema#Tango dâ€™Oro|Tanga d'Oro]] in Odema. Rumors of various disappearances of those who wander into these areas begin circulating.

These portals may be the intersection of the Fae Wild and the Material Plane. Another theory is that the Fae Wild, Material Plane, and Shadowfell are all getting squished together, causing planar intersections.

[[Nim]] theorizes that Nyarlathotep's resurgence may be the cause of this interplanar expansion. She also theorizes that there is a dimensional rift in [[The Empire of Dagdra#Thalanrod|Thalanrod]] that is expanding. As another result of Nyarlathotep's resurgence, the Far Realms may be breaching the Outer Plane, which would be catastrophic.
