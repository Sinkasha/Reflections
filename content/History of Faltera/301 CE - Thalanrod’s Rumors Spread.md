## 301 CE - [[Faltera/Dagdra/The Empire of Dagdra#Thalanrod\|Thalanrod]]’s Rumors Spread
The city known as “the Overdark” begins to have rumors about its sinister nature. Perhaps there is a connection to the Underdark? Or perhaps some interplanar threat? The city becomes a husk of what it once was once a man known only as [[Characters/NPCs/Grimnir]] travels to it. Not much is known about him other than the fact that he is a wickedly powerful mage who eliminates all those who cross him. The populous begins theorizing that he might be behind the auras around the world and by extension the disappearances.
