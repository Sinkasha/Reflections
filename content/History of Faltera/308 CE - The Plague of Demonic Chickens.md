## 308 CE - The Plague of Demonic Chickens

A brief plague of demonic chickens emerges from the outskirts of the vicinity of Thalanrod. A few hunters from the Thalum Mercenary Guild slayed the chickens, with some help from other wanderers. Not much about this event is recorded, as this happened over the span of 5 days. Nobody knows the exact cause, but fighters in the right place at the right time put down the chickens spreading the curse before it became a bigger problem.

According to [[Characters/NPCs/Count Canonbury]] this was happening because of opening and closing rifts and wasn't magical.
