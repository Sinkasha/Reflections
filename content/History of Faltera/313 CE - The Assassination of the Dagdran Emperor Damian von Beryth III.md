## 313 CE - The Assassination of the Dagdran Emperor Damian von Beryth III
The second emperor of the [[Faltera/Dagdra/The Empire of Dagdra\|Dagdran Empire]] was assassinated in his sleep. A few of the ministers were publicly executed in the name of justice. Supposedly, this was an act carried out by loyalists to Duessel, scheming to claim the throne for themselves. Others claim that this was done by the [[Guilds/The League of Larcenists\|League]], however this contradicts their modus operandi. The reasons for this political assassination are unknown, but Dagdra finds reason to blame [[Faltera/Fusilla/The Kingdom of Fusilla\|Fusilla]] on this, for reasons undisclosed, and thus straining political relations.

In [[Session Notes - Reflections/11 - 04.18.2024 - Glorp and Garlic Bread]] it is revealed that [[Characters/NPCs/The Order of the Fish]] assassinated the emperor and are using it as an excuse to attack Fusilla and conquer the rest of the continent.
