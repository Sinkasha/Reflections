## 347 CE - Cave-In

From [[Session Notes - Reflections/02 - 11.6.2022 - Investigating the Cave In]]. The party meets each other and investigates the cave-in and saves all the people trapped within.

According to [[Characters/NPCs/Count Canonbury]], this may have been caused by a rift ([[Session Notes - Reflections/06 - 1.25.2024 - The Count's Balls#^1a5ec3\|here]]).
