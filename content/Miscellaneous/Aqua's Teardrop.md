## Aqua's Teardrop

Discovered [[Session Notes - Reflections/16 - 06.07.2024 - The Big Boss#^023a86\|here]]. It turns the royal castle of [[Faltera/Fusilla/The Kingdom of Fusilla\|Fusilla]] into a flying castle. 

Astrid imbued some of her magic into it, it can be used to stop a frame of time whilst it retains its momentum. 

The object can be used once a day (once per long rest when attuned), freeze any obj less than 25 pounds within 20 feet, and then act on it in a way that would give it momentum.
