Discovered [[06 - 1.25.2024 - The Count's Balls#^f23f3c|here]]. A copper plated key that's slightly rusted, related to [[The Fish Crystals]]. It has a vaguely fish-like pattern on it.

It's currently in [[Nim]]'s hands. Used in [[14 - 5.23.2024 - FISH CRYSTALS]] to open a chest containing the last two [[The Fish Crystals|fish crystals]].
