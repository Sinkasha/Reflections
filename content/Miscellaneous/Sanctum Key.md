## Sanctum Key

Discovered [[Session Notes - Reflections/06 - 1.25.2024 - The Count's Balls#^f23f3c\|here]]. A copper plated key that's slightly rusted, related to [[Miscellaneous/The Fish Crystals]]. It has a vaguely fish-like pattern on it.

It's currently in [[Characters/PCs/Nim]]'s hands. Used in [[Session Notes - Reflections/14 - 5.23.2024 - FISH CRYSTALS]] to open a chest containing the last two [[Miscellaneous/The Fish Crystals\|fish crystals]].
