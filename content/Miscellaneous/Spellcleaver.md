## Spellcleaver

A mystical blade forged by [[Characters/NPCs/Ellery Woddlespin]] as a research and development project while prototyping Dynamo. It has two forms: Sheathed and Unsheathed.

Must Be attuned for the following, otherwise acts like a standard longsword:

Sheathed: 1d8 bludgeoning. Target must make a CON save. On a failed save, target is launched in the direction of the attack by 15 feet and take an additional 1d6 force damage. On a critical failure, they are knocked prone.

Unsheathed: 1d10 piercing, target must roll a save of their spellcasting ability. On a failed save, they cannot cast any spells their next turn. On a critical failure, they lose 1 spell slot with level equal to 1d4 (if no 4th level spell, lose a 3rd)

Spell Ward: (Recharge 11-12, Reaction): You holds the unsheathed blade and it glows gray. You slice any ranged spell attack that would otherwise hit you.

Acquired [[Session Notes - Reflections/14 - 5.23.2024 - FISH CRYSTALS#^07277f\|here]], given to [[Characters/PCs/Sarah]]. Taken off of [[Characters/NPCs/Drake]]'s body.
