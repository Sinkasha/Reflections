# The Count's Orb
*Colloquially referred to as the Count's balls* 

Discovered in [[Count Canonbury]]'s Manor by the party ([[06 - 1.25.2024 - The Count's Balls#^487ae4|here]]). The orb was created to house a rift which allowed people to enter the Material Plane from the Fae Wild. This is a one-way portal. 

According to [[Seliph Orsterra]] ([[07 - 2.6.2024 - The Count Dies, Goodbye Bugbear, Hello Sarah#^702435|here]]) the orb is a medium through which rifts can be amplified. 

It is made of a sparkly dust on the inside, as found [[13 - 5.02.2024 - Weed Patty#^24e6b4|here]].
