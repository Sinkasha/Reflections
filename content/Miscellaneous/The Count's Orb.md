# The Count's Orb

_Colloquially referred to as the Count's balls_

Discovered in [[Characters/NPCs/Count Canonbury]]'s Manor by the party ([[Session Notes - Reflections/06 - 1.25.2024 - The Count's Balls#^487ae4\|here]]). The orb was created to house a rift which allowed people to enter the Material Plane from the Fae Wild. This is a one-way portal.

According to [[Characters/NPCs/Seliph Orsterra]] ([[Session Notes - Reflections/07 - 2.6.2024 - The Count Dies, Goodbye Bugbear, Hello Sarah#^702435\|here]]) the orb is a medium through which rifts can be amplified.

It is made of a sparkly dust on the inside, as found [[Session Notes - Reflections/13 - 5.02.2024 - Weed Patty#^24e6b4\|here]].
