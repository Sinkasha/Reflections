# The Fish Crystals

Belongs to [[The Order of the Fish]]. There are 7 total in the colors of the rainbow and one white. They are keys to pedestals in [[The Empire of Dagdra#Windrest|Windrest]]. 

Nim's college may have had a secret fish cult. 

The red herring was discovered in [[Count Canonbury]]'s Manor by the party ([[05 - 1.18.2024 - Canonbury Manor Heist#^65b59d|here]]). Count Canonbury mentions that he needs to meet up with the other fish bearers ([[06 - 1.25.2024 - The Count's Balls#^97a761|here]]). The count is adamant about *not* breaking the fish crystals ([[07 - 2.6.2024 - The Count Dies, Goodbye Bugbear, Hello Sarah#^b483c1|here]]). The [[Sanctum Key]] that was discovered on his body ([[06 - 1.25.2024 - The Count's Balls#^f23f3c|here]]) is related to the fish. 

The green fish was discovered in a glowing green amulet acquired while on the trip to Ashfall [[08 - 2.29.2024 - A Journey of Self-Discovery (for half the table)#^bf0c60|here]]. Along with this crystal was a map of Windrest in southeastern [[The Empire of Dagdra|Dagdra]]. [[Nim]] has been there. It points to an area that Nim had thought suspicious during her visit. 

A yellow fish was discovered on [[Jeice]]'s body [[09 - 4.04.2024 - The Consequences of Our Actions#^961ee1|here]]. Also on his body was a card with both the LoL callsign and fish emblem, which just said "The Order will Prevail". 

An orange fish was discovered in the possession of [[Hugo Starling]] who acquired it at [[The Kingdom of Fusilla#Everholden|Everholden]] , stealing it from [[Dude 2]]. He was trying to give it to Duke Navil, the Prime Minister of [[The Kingdom of Fusilla|Fusilla]]. 

A blue fish was found with [[Mikhail]], whom the party killed and took the fish crystal. 

A purple and white fish was found in the dungeon in [[14 - 5.23.2024 - FISH CRYSTALS]]. It was in a chest that was unlocked with the [[Sanctum Key]] accessible via elevator. 

The 7 fish crystals unlocked a room with a shrine of a very fish like humanoid holding a trident, made of white marble with a golden inscription stating it is a god of [[Religion of Faltera#God of the Ocean Nautica|Nautica]]. The statue accepted one of the swirly portal orbs as an offering. After a 10 minute ritual, it turned into [[Susanoo]] and [[Watatsumi]], a legendary pair of ocean serpent fans.
