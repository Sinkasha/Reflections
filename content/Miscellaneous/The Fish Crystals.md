# The Fish Crystals

Belongs to [[Characters/NPCs/The Order of the Fish]]. There are 7 total in the colors of the rainbow and one white. They are keys to pedestals in [[Faltera/Dagdra/The Empire of Dagdra#Windrest\|Windrest]].

Nim's college may have had a secret fish cult.

The red herring was discovered in [[Characters/NPCs/Count Canonbury]]'s Manor by the party ([[Session Notes - Reflections/05 - 1.18.2024 - Canonbury Manor Heist#^65b59d\|here]]). Count Canonbury mentions that he needs to meet up with the other fish bearers ([[Session Notes - Reflections/06 - 1.25.2024 - The Count's Balls#^97a761\|here]]). The count is adamant about _not_ breaking the fish crystals ([[Session Notes - Reflections/07 - 2.6.2024 - The Count Dies, Goodbye Bugbear, Hello Sarah#^b483c1\|here]]). The [[Miscellaneous/Sanctum Key]] that was discovered on his body ([[Session Notes - Reflections/06 - 1.25.2024 - The Count's Balls#^f23f3c\|here]]) is related to the fish.

The green fish was discovered in a glowing green amulet acquired while on the trip to Ashfall [[Session Notes - Reflections/08 - 2.29.2024 - A Journey of Self-Discovery (for half the table)#^bf0c60\|here]]. Along with this crystal was a map of Windrest in southeastern [[Faltera/Dagdra/The Empire of Dagdra\|Dagdra]]. [[Characters/PCs/Nim]] has been there. It points to an area that Nim had thought suspicious during her visit.

A yellow fish was discovered on [[Characters/NPCs/Jeice]]'s body [[Session Notes - Reflections/09 - 4.04.2024 - The Consequences of Our Actions#^961ee1\|here]]. Also on his body was a card with both the LoL callsign and fish emblem, which just said "The Order will Prevail".

An orange fish was discovered in the possession of [[Characters/NPCs/Hugo Starling]] who acquired it at [[Faltera/Fusilla/The Kingdom of Fusilla#Everholden\|Everholden]] , stealing it from [[Characters/NPCs/Dude 2]]. He was trying to give it to Duke Navil, the Prime Minister of [[Faltera/Fusilla/The Kingdom of Fusilla\|Fusilla]].

A blue fish was found with [[Characters/NPCs/Mikhail]], whom the party killed and took the fish crystal.

A purple and white fish was found in the dungeon in [[Session Notes - Reflections/14 - 5.23.2024 - FISH CRYSTALS]]. It was in a chest that was unlocked with the [[Miscellaneous/Sanctum Key]] accessible via elevator.

The 7 fish crystals unlocked a room with a shrine of a very fish like humanoid holding a trident, made of white marble with a golden inscription stating it is a god of [[Religion/Religion of Faltera#God of the Ocean Nautica\|Nautica]]. The statue accepted one of the swirly portal orbs as an offering. After a 10 minute ritual, it turned into [[Miscellaneous/Susanoo]] and [[Miscellaneous/Watatsumi]], a legendary pair of ocean serpent fans.
