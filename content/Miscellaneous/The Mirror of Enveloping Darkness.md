## The Mirror of Enveloping Darkness

Historical records claim that the mirror was created in [[The Holy State of Odema]] in 212 CE by two mysterious mages. However, the Mirror is much older than that, having existed before written history (mages and academia suppressing this knowledge) and the glass in the mirror was originally used to seal [[Religion of Faltera#Nyarlathotep|Nyarlathotep]]'s avatar. It was discovered by the two mysterious Odemian mages who unsealed it, unaware of its original purpose who then presented it as a present to the revolution a year later.

The mirror reveals to the beholder the worst traits in them, and magnifies it. This manifests in the beholder if they lack the resolve to fight off the temptation. If the beholder of the mirror can resist, they are granted total control over psychic and necrotic abilities.Â 

People who look into the mirror become a vessel for Nyarlathotep's avatar. Many of Nyarlathotep's followers back when Nyarlathotep was more popular was trying to find a vessel for Nyarlathotep to possess through the Mirror. Failed vessels resulted in Gnolls (hyenas turned into demons).

In [[213 CE - The Leader of the Revolutionaries Succumbs to the Mirror|213 CE]], the Revolutionary Leader, [[Duessel Sarde]], succumbs to the temptation and goes berserk. What follows is the [[213 CE - The Falteran Massacre|Falteran Massacre]]. In [[215 CE - The Council of Archmages is Formed|215 CE]], [[The Council of Archmages]] is formed for the express purpose of dealing with the Mirror. The Council shatters the mirror to prevent Nyarlathotep from escaping again and the shards are separated. The current locations of the shards are unknown. They fabricated the history of the mirror being made in Odemia.

It is theorized by the party that one shard may be in the royal castle of Parli. Another shard is within [[Yul]].

As long as the Mirror is missing shards, it will not be at its full strength.
