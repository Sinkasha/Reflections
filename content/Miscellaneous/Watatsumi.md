## Watatsumi

The blue fan has powers of the water, giving this fan a suspended liquid shape until you change it. You have the ability to freeze and unfreeze the water to the shape of the fan itself. This cannot extend the range of this weapon to reach, however. Its unattuned state is a deep blue, crystal-esque fan. 

Nonmagical Damage: 1d4 slashing
**When Attuned:**
Requires a Command Word*
Damage: 1d6 cold + 1d4 slashing when frozen, 1d6 fire + 1d4 force when the fan is made of steam.
Shape Fan: As a bonus action, you may choose how to shape the fan, and whether or not the fan is ice, liquid water, or steam.
Water Mastery: Twice per long rest, you may choose to cast one of the following spells as an action:
- Water Breathing
- Water Walk
- Wall of Water
