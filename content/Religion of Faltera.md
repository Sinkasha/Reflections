# Religion of Faltera: The Pantheon
The gods of Faltera reside in the Astral Plane, far above the moral realm. They have physical manifestations on occasion. They have mortal incarnations and descendants, referred to as The Marked. These people have tremendous power based on their progenitor. [^1]

Generally, large metropolitan areas favor big gods, and coastal cities favor gods of the sky and ocean.

[^1]: As a note to the readers, these names are merely inspiration, and should not be taken as to assume that these deities are exactly like the mythological counterparts. These are namesakes and you should not necessarily draw upon prior knowledge of these gods as that will not necessarily give you more insight into how they function in Faltera.
