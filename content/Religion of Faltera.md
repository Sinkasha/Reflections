# Religion of Faltera: The Pantheon
The gods of Faltera reside in the Astral Plane, far above the moral realm. They have physical manifestations on occasion. They have mortal incarnations and descendants, referred to as The Marked. These people have tremendous power based on their progenitor. [^1]

Generally, large metropolitan areas favor big gods, and coastal cities favor gods of the sky and ocean. 

**The Gods' Symbols:**

### Gods of Natural Forces
These are the gods who govern natural forces of the universe, beyond the heavens, and into the very existence of mortals.

##### God of Life: Yddris
*Lawful Neutral*
Governing the forces of life itself, Yddris is the most prayed to god of the modern pantheon. Yddris is seen as a beacon for the gift of life, and it is said that they bless mortals with a gift of a long, healthy life. They are celebrated as the reason for life in Faltera and the mortal realm, even though that may not necessarily be true…

##### God of Death: Nyx
*Lawful Neutral*
Nyx governs the forces of death and the passage to the afterlife. They are generally viewed as an arbitrator between the living and the dead, rather than some malevolent being. There is some superstition about their worship, but Nyx remains a neutral god with no ill will towards humanity. As confirmed by [[Religion of Faltera#Goddess of the Water Thetis|Thetis]], it appears Nyx has no relationship to [[Religion of Faltera#God of Death Nyarlathotep|Nyarlathotep]].

##### God of Nature: Forsyth
*Lawful Good*
Governing the beauty of life outside of humanity, Forsyth oversees the sprawling fauna of Faltera. She acts to preserve the good of nature, from the innocent wildlife to the plants that beautify the world.

##### God of the Ocean: Nautica
*Chaotic Neutral*
Nautica governs the seas, the tides, and everything in the ocean that isn’t under the gravitational influence of Lumis.
Sailors pray to Nautica in hopes of calm waters for save seafaring travel, and as a result, Nautica is most prayed to in the coasts, especially [[The Hyritian Alliance|Hyritia]]. May have created [[The Fish Crystals]].

##### God of the Sky: Aeros
*Chaotic Neutral*
The god of the sky governs the winds and skies of Faltera, and in a sense is an embodiment of freedom. 
Is celebrated in the sky festival during the apex of spring.

### Gods of Human Nature
As humanity evolved, so too did the pantheon. The Gods of Human Nature, while not exclusive to humans necessarily, are a reflection of the sentient and more complex feelings of beings. These gods are split from [[Religion of Faltera#God of Consciousness Azathoth|Azathoth]]. 

##### God of Greed: Lucius
*Chaotic Neutral*
The manifestation of human greed and hubris.

![[God of Greed Symbol.png|100]]

##### Goddess of Honesty: Veritus
*Unknown*
She died fighting two of [[Religion of Faltera#God of Death Nyarlathotep|Nyarlathotep's]] generals, Abyss and Emptiness. She seems to [[20 - 8.7.2024 - Chat is this real#^d269fb|know]] something important about Nyarlathotep. 
"Only a scant few know that honesty's true hue is a deep sea blue"
"the blue blood of magic flows, the red essence of life flows, the restoration of purple flows"

## Elemental Gods
Gods of the primordial elements, predating and coexisting with the primitive gods. Potentially descendants of [[Religion of Faltera#God of Consciousness Azathoth|Azathoth]], who were entrusted with bringing him back with the prediction of his demise at Nyarlathotep's hands. According to Thetis, the elemental gods never tried to intervene with the material plane. In this case, they only intervened because of Nyarlathotep's actions. 
##### Goddess of the Water: Thetis

Thetis appreciates offerings of mortal sentimental value. Thetis's essence has been contained within a Sapphire by another unknown God, likely [[Religion of Faltera#God of Consciousness Azathoth|Azathoth]] from this snippet of conversation: 
> Thetis, I implore you to submerge your palace and seal it away. I fear we are amidst a conflict upon our very pantheon. Since the fusions, your powers have not been what they used to be. I will contain your essence in this Sapphire, trusting my descendants will awaken you once more. Guide them here, help them revive you. Even if we slay him now, his descendants will seek revenge. We cannot afford to lose you, our master of water. 

Thetis's prayer states for unlocking something in her underwater temple: 
> Flowing healing water
> Divine streams of life
> Oh great seal
> I purge the darkness. 

##### God of ??: Prometheus

Thetis mentioned him as her brother. 

## Primitive Gods
According to Thetis, the 3 primitive gods have no direct lineage. The elemental gods are the closest things to a lineage that Azathoth has. 
##### God of Death: Nyarlathotep
*Depreciated God of Death*
Nyarlathotep is the ancient god of death, controlling passage into the astral plane. Most of Nyarlathotep's worshippers were in modern day [[The Holy State of Odema]] and the Beryth territory in [[The Empire of Dagdra]]. Nyarlathotep is in the Far Realms, and sent an avatar to the Material Plane, who would've been a willing worshipper of them. 

About 400 years ago (not in the Current Era), worship of Nyarlathotep died out because Nyarlathotep was trying to gain power over life and death itself and made an enemy of all the other gods. Nyarlathotep was trying to usurp the power of the original progenitor power. One of his major opponents was [[Religion of Faltera#God of Life Genesis|Genesis]]. The worshippers of the other gods killed Nyarlathotep's worshippers to weaken him. Worshippers of Genesis sealed Nyarlathotep's avatar on the Material Plane into [[The Mirror of Enveloping Darkness]], attempting to keep his spirit trapped in a limbo in the mirror. 

During the war between the gods, Nyarlathotep killed Yeenoghu, the God of Gnolls, and took his power. This is why failed vessels who look into the Mirror turn into Gnolls. 

In modern day, [[The Order of the Fish]] worship Nyarlathotep. 

Nyarlathotep has 8 Sinister Vows, who are super loyal followers of Nyarlathotep. Not much is known about them as history has been intentionally obfuscated. 
1. Abyss, General/Apostle of Nyarlathotep, similar in role / function to Hades, but isn't a Plane, more so a conceptual being. It's more than just an all consuming abyss. [[Religion of Faltera#Goddess of Honesty Veritus|Veritus]] is fighting Abyss, and according to Thetis, died to Abyss and Emptiness while fighting them both. Abyss embodies emptiness. 
2. Emptyness, Veritus is fighting them too. 
3. King Hades, Ruler of the Plane of Hades, is the third vow of Nyarlathotep. In order to summon him, one must carry out a specific divine ritual. Its requirements include 3 severed heads, dried roots and ashes of the roots of a petricite tree in [[The Kingdom of Fusilla#Geimshall Woods|Geimshall Woods]]. The ritual takes 2 hours and requires immense concentration, hand gestures, and a summoning circle. According to [[Astrid von Novis]], Hades is just a personification. 
4. Ruin, the strongest Sinister Vow. He has the ability to destroy anything he comes in contact or near with. If his full power is regained, he could wipe out all of Faltera. 

##### God of Life: Genesis
*Depreciated God of Life*
In their prime, Genesis was equal in power to Nyarlathotep. 
Genesis's worshippers were mostly in the northern regions of Faltera, including Frostwind, Hyritia, and stretching into Fusilla. 
There is a theory in academic circles that [[Religion of Faltera#God of Life Yddris|Yddris]] and [[Religion of Faltera#God of Death Nyx|Nyx]] are two halves of Genesis, which is likely untrue. Thetis says Genesis would be angry to find another god masquerading as the god of life. Genesis was vain. Apparently he may have been complicit in Nyarlathotep's evildoings.

##### God of Consciousness: Azathoth
*Ancestor to the Gods of Human Nature*
One of the progenitor gods, the primitive god of consciousness, which gave creatures consciousness and intelligence. They find humanity intriguing. The God of Consciousness does not like [[Religion of Faltera#God of Death Nyarlathotep|Nyarlathotep]] who believes he should be the only one with sentience and intelligence and swears to go for Azathoth's head. Furthermore, one can't be conscious when they are dead. He is equal in power to Nyarlathotep. He finds humanity endearing. 

Assisted in creating the [[Crown of the Elements]]. 

At some point in time he split himself into multiple gods, now known as the [[Religion of Faltera#Gods of Human Nature|Gods of Human Nature]]. The four that are common knowledge are chaos, order, fortune, and greed, but it's believed among academics who research this he has more parts. [[Nim]] knows of two others, Benevolence and Malice. Due to the presence of the 10 pillars in the ruin in [[The Kingdom of Fusilla#Everholden|Everholden]] which also has Azathoth's bust, it is likely that he split himself into 10 gods. However, based on the [[21 - 8.22.2024 - Killed a Fake Dragon#^fa89eb|vision]] that was seen when sitting on the throne in Everholden, Azathoth split himself into 9 clay statues. The inscriptions on the [[20 - 8.7.2024 - Chat is this real#^b4bb68|pillars]] are (the gods in the parentheses are guesses as to which god relates to which inscription and unless bolded are not confirmed): 
1. As it is divinely ordained all shall be mine *(Greed)*
2. The true beauty of life lies in its structure *(Order)*
3. Others shall be crushed beneath my heel *(Malice)*
4. *scratched out* 
5. Only in truth shall we find true justice *(Honesty, Veritus)*
6. It is writ therefore it is thus *(Justice?)*
7. Unpredictability is the highest virtue *(Chaos, Hrym)*
8. Mind, body, and soul as one
9. May the golden wind bless us all *(Fortune)*
10. *scratched out*

Veritus, Lucius, Hrym, Aurus
