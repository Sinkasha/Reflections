# God of Consciousness Azathoth
*Ancestor to the Gods of Human Nature*
One of the progenitor gods, the primitive god of consciousness, which gave creatures consciousness and intelligence. They find humanity intriguing. The God of Consciousness does not like [[Religion of Faltera#God of Death Nyarlathotep|Nyarlathotep]] who believes he should be the only one with sentience and intelligence and swears to go for Azathoth's head. Furthermore, one can't be conscious when they are dead. He is equal in power to Nyarlathotep. He finds humanity endearing. 

Assisted in creating the [[Crown of the Elements]]. 

At some point in time he split himself into multiple gods, now known as the [[Religion of Faltera#Gods of Human Nature|Gods of Human Nature]]. The four that are common knowledge are chaos, order, fortune, and greed, but it's believed among academics who research this he has more parts. [[Nim]] knows of two others, Benevolence and Malice. Due to the presence of the 10 pillars in the ruin in [[The Kingdom of Fusilla#Everholden|Everholden]] which also has Azathoth's bust, it is likely that he split himself into 10 gods. However, based on the [[21 - 8.22.2024 - Killed a Fake Dragon#^fa89eb|vision]] that was seen when sitting on the throne in Everholden, Azathoth split himself into 9 clay statues. The inscriptions on the [[20 - 8.7.2024 - Chat is this real#^b4bb68|pillars]] are (the gods in the parentheses are guesses as to which god relates to which inscription and unless bolded are not confirmed): 
1. As it is divinely ordained all shall be mine *(Greed)*
2. The true beauty of life lies in its structure *(Order)*
3. Others shall be crushed beneath my heel *(Malice)*
4. *scratched out* 
5. Only in truth shall we find true justice *(Honesty, Veritus)*
6. It is writ therefore it is thus *(Justice?)*
7. Unpredictability is the highest virtue *(Chaos, Hrym)*
8. Mind, body, and soul as one
9. May the golden wind bless us all *(Fortune)*
10. *scratched out*
