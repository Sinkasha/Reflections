# God of Death: Nyarlathotep
*Depreciated God of Death*
Nyarlathotep is the ancient god of death, controlling passage into the astral plane. Most of Nyarlathotep's worshippers were in modern day [[Faltera/Odema/The Holy State of Odema]] and the Beryth territory in [[Faltera/Dagdra/The Empire of Dagdra]]. Nyarlathotep is in the Far Realms, and sent an avatar to the Material Plane, who would've been a willing worshipper of them. 

About 400 years ago (not in the Current Era), worship of Nyarlathotep died out because Nyarlathotep was trying to gain power over life and death itself and made an enemy of all the other gods. Nyarlathotep was trying to usurp the power of the original progenitor power. One of his major opponents was [[Religion of Faltera#God of Life Genesis\|Genesis]]. The worshippers of the other gods killed Nyarlathotep's worshippers to weaken him. Worshippers of Genesis sealed Nyarlathotep's avatar on the Material Plane into [[Miscellaneous/The Mirror of Enveloping Darkness]], attempting to keep his spirit trapped in a limbo in the mirror. 

During the war between the gods, Nyarlathotep killed Yeenoghu, the God of Gnolls, and took his power. This is why failed vessels who look into the Mirror turn into Gnolls. 

In modern day, [[Characters/NPCs/The Order of the Fish]] worship Nyarlathotep. 

Nyarlathotep has 8 Sinister Vows, who are super loyal followers of Nyarlathotep. Not much is known about them as history has been intentionally obfuscated. 
1. Abyss, General/Apostle of Nyarlathotep, similar in role / function to Hades, but isn't a Plane, more so a conceptual being. It's more than just an all consuming abyss. [[Religion of Faltera#Goddess of Honesty Veritus\|Veritus]] is fighting Abyss, and according to Thetis, died to Abyss and Emptiness while fighting them both. Abyss embodies emptiness. 
2. Emptyness, Veritus is fighting them too. 
3. King Hades, Ruler of the Plane of Hades, is the third vow of Nyarlathotep. In order to summon him, one must carry out a specific divine ritual. Its requirements include 3 severed heads, dried roots and ashes of the roots of a petricite tree in [[Faltera/Fusilla/The Kingdom of Fusilla#Geimshall Woods\|Geimshall Woods]]. The ritual takes 2 hours and requires immense concentration, hand gestures, and a summoning circle. According to [[Characters/NPCs/Astrid von Novis]], Hades is just a personification. 
4. Ruin, the strongest Sinister Vow. He has the ability to destroy anything he comes in contact or near with. If his full power is regained, he could wipe out all of Faltera.
