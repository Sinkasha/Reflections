# God of Death: Nyx
*Lawful Neutral*

![[../Images/God of Death Symbol.png|100]]

Nyx governs the forces of death and the passage to the afterlife. They are generally viewed as an arbitrator between the living and the dead, rather than some malevolent being. There is some superstition about their worship, but Nyx remains a neutral god with no ill will towards humanity. As confirmed by [[Religion of Faltera#Goddess of the Water Thetis\|Thetis]], it appears Nyx has no relationship to [[Religion of Faltera#God of Death Nyarlathotep\|Nyarlathotep]].
