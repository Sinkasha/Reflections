# God of Life Genesis

_Depreciated God of Life_
In their prime, Genesis was equal in power to Nyarlathotep.
Genesis's worshippers were mostly in the northern regions of Faltera, including Frostwind, Hyritia, and stretching into Fusilla.
There is a theory in academic circles that [[Religion/Religion of Faltera#God of Life Yddris\|Yddris]] and [[Religion/Religion of Faltera#God of Death Nyx\|Nyx]] are two halves of Genesis, which is likely untrue. Thetis says Genesis would be angry to find another god masquerading as the god of life. Genesis was vain. Apparently he may have been complicit in Nyarlathotep's evildoings.
