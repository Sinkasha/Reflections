Governing the forces of life itself, Yddris is the most prayed to god of the modern pantheon. Yddris is seen as a beacon for the gift of life, and it is said that they bless mortals with a gift of a long, healthy life. They are celebrated as the reason for life in Faltera and the mortal realm, even though that may not necessarily be trueâ€¦
