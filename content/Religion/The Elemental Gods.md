# The Elemental Gods

Gods of the primordial elements, predating and coexisting with the primitive gods. Potentially descendants of [[Religion of Faltera#God of Consciousness Azathoth\|Azathoth]], who were entrusted with bringing him back with the prediction of his demise at Nyarlathotep's hands. According to Thetis, the elemental gods never tried to intervene with the material plane. In this case, they only intervened because of Nyarlathotep's actions. 
##### Goddess of the Water: Thetis

Thetis appreciates offerings of mortal sentimental value. Thetis's essence has been contained within a Sapphire by another unknown God, likely [[Religion of Faltera#God of Consciousness Azathoth\|Azathoth]] from this snippet of conversation: 
> Thetis, I implore you to submerge your palace and seal it away. I fear we are amidst a conflict upon our very pantheon. Since the fusions, your powers have not been what they used to be. I will contain your essence in this Sapphire, trusting my descendants will awaken you once more. Guide them here, help them revive you. Even if we slay him now, his descendants will seek revenge. We cannot afford to lose you, our master of water. 

Thetis's prayer states for unlocking something in her underwater temple: 
> Flowing healing water
> Divine streams of life
> Oh great seal
> I purge the darkness. 

##### God of ??: Prometheus

Thetis mentioned him as her brother.
