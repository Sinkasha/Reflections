# Personal Trials
## Session 4
##### TLDR
- We escape the portal with the duck. The duck gives us all a personal challenge, except Bloo, who is suffering from memory loss. In the personal challenge, each party member (except Bloo??) talks/fights a version of themselves. As a reward, everyone gets cool weapons. Afterwards, when heading back to the town, the duck is named Edwin and we are recruited by Seliph into the Vasara Adventuring Guild. 
- PCs involved: 
	- [[Characters/PCs/Bloo]]
	- [[Characters/PCs/Amoiváda]]
	- [[Characters/PCs/Skaga]]
	- [[Characters/NPCs/Marcan Beakoup]]

- Hear crystal clack clack, hear footsteps, assume its comrades, turn around, and see Skaga
- Everywhere only see reflections of yourself
- You are in a reflective cave, in a geode, everyone except Bloo sees this
- Skaga is just standing there, not mimicking their actions, she looks proud and confident

##### Skaga 2
- endless reflections
- dunno how far the figure is
- Skaga: "Who are you!?" "Where am I? What is happening"
	- No response
- Stride confidently towards it, chest puffed out, draw sword
- The person matches Skaga's confidence walks towards her, wearing heavy plate armor, draws a sword like hers
- Skaga real: "I won't fight you if I don't have to"
	- "Are you sure you don't have to?" it's Skaga's voice
	- Real: "Who are you, where is this"
	- Fake: "You ask too many questions"
	- It's Skaga's face
	- Real: "Thief, GIVE ME BACK MY FACE!"
	- Fake: "You still have your own face, if you don't believe me, take out the mirror in your pocket"
	- Real: "Did you put this here"
	- Fake: "I am here, so I suppose I did"
	- Take out mirror, it's exactly reflection, throw the mirror behind you, hear cracking
	- Fake: "Don't like what you see?"
	- Real: "I don't trust you. I don't believe it. You aren't me. You can't be. "
	- Fake: "How can you prove that"
	- Points sword at fake Skaga
	- Real: "I suppose to defend myself, my identity, my honor, I guess we must fight"
	- Fake: "Trust me, I don't bear any ill will"
	- Stride towards them and strike them
		- Swing down, and then just stop, as soon as you stop, sword pointed at throat already
	- Fake Skaga says "try again but be less predictable, I know your every move, isn't that the definition of predictable"
	- Skaga strikes again but with flair, leap strikes, as soon as real Skaga swing down, you hear clink metal, see a perfect parry
		- Successfully overpower the parry, slam down on ground, knock them back a bit
	- Fake: "I knew you were one for flair, but that one was new, alright two can play this game"
	- Fake Skaga walks up, tries to strike, you block, tries to strike other side, you block again, hilts clash, knock them back and they fall to the ground
	- Fake Skaga: "Your move"
	- Skaga approaches them, points sword at them right up in their face, "What do you want?"
	- Fake Skaga is completely unfazed, real Skaga: "Speak again, what is your aim?"
	- Real: "I've won haven't I, I've passed the trial"
	- Fake: "Have you"
	- Real: "I've bested you in this fight, I've matched your blows, your confidence"
	- Fake: "Are you sure"
	- Real: "I am "
	- Fake: "Are you"
	- Real: "I am"
	- Fake: "I hear hesitation, now turn around"
	- Real: "No, I am certain, I am me, you are a trickster, I have won"
	- Fake: "Then strike me down, do it in one blow, or I will not recognize you"
	- Real: "Then I will"
	- The blade slices straight through them
	- Fake: "I'm still standing, I'll give you one more chance, you need to grow more"
	- Real: "I'll take it"
	- Slice through them, they start fading, "I suppose you will win, for now, just remember, you are more than just the outward visage you put on"
	- And with that, you feel a little tired and you pass out
##### Amoivada 2
- Big blob, approach blob, dunno what it is
- Amoivada: "Are you one of my kind?" Blomp
- Approach reluctantly, take a somewhat circular path
- Blob looks at you, eyes behave similarly to Amoivada, it smiles at Amoivada, who smiles back
- They approach like a water balloon rolling, it asks
	- Fake: "What r u doing here" inquisitive and curious
	- Real: "I dunno, I have no goals"
	- Fake: "That is okay"
	- Real: "Wbu"
	- Fake: "I'm here to connect to you a little more to your past should you choose to accept it, please approach me"
	- Amoivada moves very quickly towards it, no hesitation
	- When you approach it, it engulfs you, plays out *like* giant iMax
	- See visions of the past, see a forest, crystal clear beautiful pond, looks serene, see fairies, an elf tending garden, see birbs and bears, feel you are in this scene, feel a strong connection, when you get ideas, new scene
	- Cold frigid mountains, beautiful, aurora among stars, snow comes down like diamonds glittering
	- Fake: "Do you know why I'm showing u this?"
	- Real: "No, it's pretty"
	- Fake: "That is ok, do you know who u r"
	- Silence
	- Fake: "That is ok, I imagine you don't have many memories from this time, do you recall a time before the [[Faltera/Dagdra/The Empire of Dagdra]] was established"
	- Silence
	- Fake: "I'll take that as a no, here is what it looked like", last thing you see is visions of ppl, castle thriving with ppl, queen on throne who stands proudly, all of her citizens are welcoming her, she announces prosperity of kingdom, but this is short-lived, time is scrolling really fast, see vision of countless fallen soldiers, this is [[Faltera/Dagdra/The Empire of Dagdra#Thalanrod\|Thalanrod]]
	- You don't know what it is, you feel like you have a connection
	- Fake: "I am showing u this because u need to understand yourself and the role u play in this world, what do u seek in life"
	- Real: *confused noises* "I seek peace and also healing and also nature"
	- Fake: "That is very admirable, would you like me to help u"
	- Real: "Yes plz"
	- Fake: "Then…" the slime retracts and shifts towards form just like you, and got bopped, feel some weird going on, the slime looks like Amoivada and is now being absorbed by Amoivada, now feel more powerful, then fades to black

	- Duck: "Concentrate on how you felt when you stepped through the portal, now think about what you've learned, I assure you, there will be an immediate reward, now concentrate and hold out your hands"
	- Everyone gets fancy shmancy weapons
		- Attuned to these weapons, you can call and dismiss these weapons, call as main action, like equipping, you don't need to carry it on you, if it breaks it regenerates after 8 hour concentration meditation

	- Quill: "Taxes?"
	- Seliph: "You should be paying them regardless…."
	- Quill: "Do we get free food"
	- Seliph: "When I decide to treat y'all to a feast"
