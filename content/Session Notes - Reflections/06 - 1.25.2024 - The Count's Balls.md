##### The Count's Journal

- Full journal across span of 2 years, in short notes a bunch of information about [[Miscellaneous/The Count's Orb]]
  - Orb wasn't actually created as an orb, the glass contains a rift, the orb was constructed around the rift
  - Count was lead researcher, became paranoid and distrustful, his wording gets more and more crazy
  - Cryptic things:
    - Fish logo, sketch that matches the red herring crystal
    - Says that it's not the only one of its kind, he needs to meet up with the other bearers of the fish ^97a761
    - Mentions an incident a few months back in crescent grove and ruins, notes that there must've been an idiot who broke the seal, a cursed puppet that rumors are spreading, but no puppets will reach Fusilla because of distance ^45371e
      - Cursed blood puppet
    - [[History of Faltera/308 CE - The Plague of Demonic Chickens\|Demonic chickens outrage]] from a few years back, a bunch of animals were able to talk and talk and sentient like humans, but it's not magical, rifts were opening and closing ^1a5ec3
      - A rift that happened 2 nights prior, unfinished entry, big shake related to [[History of Faltera/347 CE - Cave-In]] ^7b720b
  - 2 names, "[[Characters/NPCs/Astrid von Novis]]" (one of the archmages in the counsel, one of the strongest mages in the world), another name, first one is scratched out, says "[[Characters/NPCs/Horace Frostdir\|Frostdir]]" below it, paired names, diagram of map, northern most part of Fusilla which has a ruin ^c455da
    - A bunch of names that are not recognized
    - Grouped by affiliation
- Mar goes to go back to armor, and mends it, and gets a suit of armor
- Bugbear walks over the orb, the sack is not closed, it's just over the orb
- Skaga asks the fairies, the orb is one-way portal
- Bugbear tries to pull the drawstring, pulls really hard and hears a little snap, it appears to be glass but not the orb itself, the glass pedestal broke
  - Picks it up with ease, still glowing like a disco ball
- Mar investigates the mechanical box in the back left corner of the room, it looks like it has hinges, not a duo drone, fully deactivated, fully devoid of anything that could make it move
- Mar uses Mage Hand to open the box, it's a lifeless autognome, a mechanical gnome, but it seems dead, it's just a machine, it seems like it was once alive, research assistant
- Bugbear pitches the autognome at Mar and Mar will hit it with the bat, Mar throws the axe, let's it spin, and then catches it again like a baseball player, and then whacks the autognome with the flat side of the axe, and whacks it perfectly into the spikes
- Fairies: "just leave us here", as eating banana
- Bugbear carries the count marine style, and Nim sticks with Bugbear, Skaga checks in with the fairies, walk towards the mirror, Bloo touches the mirror, feels like being pulled in
- Skaga Mar and Nim and Lyra and hold the rope tied around Bloo's waist to prevent falling in
- Bloo sees a flash of light, see a lot of people Bloo doesn't recognize, tall strong human man, massive greatsword, short gnome with a wrench sitting on a thing, flash by
  - Bloo walks in a bit more
  - Bloo is on the complete other side of the mirror now but the rope is still taut
  - The party pulls on the rope, and it's much lighter now, bloo's body flops out and it's a corpse
  - Noise from adjacent room, clinks,
  - Something happened to the orb
  - Flash and sound from the other room
  - See a limp kenku body, it doesn't feel like a corpse, no blood no pulse, like nothing was here from the mirror
  - Hear noise and flash of light from the other room
  - This corpse appears to be dead for a very long long time
- Mar looks over into the other room, formerly where the orb is there's a tiny glint, and over where the spikes are there's a bit of rustling
- Bugbear slipped past all of the rest of the party and is basically gone now
- Mar investigates the rustling, Bugbear comes back??? and the count's body is gone
  - Bugbear investigates the kenku, killed by magical damage
- Mar approaches cautiously, see something weird blobby ish rustling over to a pile, it's a green blob, Mar looks at it,
  - Inside the rustling pile of things, and something emerges from the pile, up come a tortle but it's body is rigid and now more fluid
  - A tortle corpse under the pile of spikes, and now Bloo inhabits a tortle
  - The fairies look at Skaga, "The creature you were with is fine"
