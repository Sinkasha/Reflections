### [[Faltera/Fusilla/The Kingdom of Fusilla#Canonbury\|Canonbury, Fusilla]], The Tavern,

- We woke up on time (CRAZY?)
- [[Characters/NPCs/Seliph Orsterra]] is standing in the main entrance of the empty tavern
- Seliph: You're heading off to Ashfall, I've arranged a carriage. It's free. Y'all are hitching a ride on a caravan. I hope y'all don't mind"
- Sarah: Private transportation?
- Seliph: Only from Ashfall to the capital
- Sarah wants to steal Seliph's horse, and Seliph said no
- Seliph: caravan leaving in 30 minutes, so get ready, safe travels, please stay alive
- Sarah casts Detect Magic: senses faint Necromancy magic on Yul around the core of her body, Yul herself is not undead
  - Detect faint traces of multiple types of magic from Bloo, illusion magic and necromancy magic concentrated around the head
- Sarah knows that Bloo is a parasite, can see Bloo's head isn't a head, is confused that the party is okay with it

### Caravan

- Tethys from the caravan: "names?"
  - Yul: "Your mom"
  - Takes role call
  - Tethys: "Mar?"
  - Mar: "sup dog"
  - Tethys: "Do I have to baby sit you Sarah, Seliph left me special instructions"
- Allotted two passenger cars
  - Tethys: "please hesitate to bother me, I'm very busy"
  - Sarah goes in the front wagon, Bloo goes in the back with Skaga and Lyra, Mar follows Sarah
  - Nim and Yul are in the front
- Travel time!!
- Sarah assumes Bloo is an extraplanar parasite living in a Tortle after having a conversation with Nim, realizes
- In the other carriage
  - Bloo is eating strawberry yogurt
- Weak conjuration magic in one of the item shipments, common for people to exchange low quality magic items

### Encampment

- Halfway between Canonbury and Ashfall, base of mountain road, fresh water nearby, setting up camp, light things up with torches
- Nim talks to Tethys, Banana is following
  - Nim: curious about shipments
  - Weapon shipments, food, artificers in the guild
  - Nim is an archaeologist, a historian
  - Tethys: "promise not to steal anything, and you can take inventory with me, don't leave my side"
  - Tethys opens the curtain
  - Sees armor stands (chain mail armor), swords, etc.
  - Tethys steps into the carriage, opens up the bottom, sees something glowing green
  - Tethys: "oh this? it's an amulet, try to see if anyone in ashfall wants it"
  - Nim: "what's it do?"
  - Tethys: "reportedly it just glows very brightly"
    - The stone doesn't look very valuable, it just glows
  - Sarah walks in
  - Nim wants to trade Mar's armor for the glowy green amulet
  - Tethys: "seliph instructed for all of count's items to be turned over"
    - Apparently all of the count's items are being seized by bureaucracy
  - Sarah casts detect magic on the amulet, finds illusion magic on it
  - Nim trades helmet for the green _very_ glowy amulet
  - Used goggles, quills, broken hat, mostly junk, could be repurposed
  - Tethys was looking for spell scrolls for Sarah, but only have weak scrolls, the good ones were sold
    - Ice Knife, Jim's Magic Missile, Jump
  - Nim trades both of Mar's armor boots for Jim's Magic Missile scroll
  - Sarah asks Yul to cast Thaumaturgy on the amulet, and it turns red
  - Sarah gets 30 silver pieces
  - Tethys gives a quill to Yul
  - Nim sells the rest of Mar's armor for 30 GP
  - Nim investigates the amulet, it's about 50 years old, made out of inexpensive gemstone (smoothed out), looks like a generic piece of cheap citrine that's green, worth no more than 5 SP
- Sarah isn't going to actively cast anything on Bloo, apparently
- Sleep and rest, wake up well-rested
- Go to the carriages
- Tethys is in the caravan with Sarah, Skaga, Nim, and Yul
  - Bloo, Mar, Lyra in one caravan

  - Nim tells Tethys we're delivering a love letter from Seliph to Lady Novis
  - Sarah: "Trying to get rich scheme again"
  - Tethys: "More get rich schemes :o"
    - Apparently Sarah tried to invent cash
  - Tethys: "I wanna go out and fight but only do tons of paperwork"
  - Sarah: "Do you think I'd lie to you"
  - Tethys: "Yes"
  - Sarah: "Damn you do know me too well"
- **Apparently Nim has a PhD in archaeology**

### [[Faltera/Fusilla/The Kingdom of Fusilla#Ashfall\|Ashfall, Fusilla]]

- Yippee made it to Ashfall
- Say bye to Tethys
- In middle of Ashfall
  - Agricultural sector (SE sector)
  - Government sector (NE sector)
  - Commercial Sector (SW Sector)
  - Residential Sector (NW Sector)
- We all decide to go shopping

##### Commercial District | It's SHOPPING TIME

- Massive gate, appears to be closed, the gate looks like it would open outward but instead it sinks into the ground
- Look for store with spell scrolls
- Magic shop, in shape of mushroom with witch hat on top
- Sarah would like to purchase 4 Identity spell scrolls
  - The dude uses 2 mage hands to find Identify spell scrolls from a big library, only finds 2
  - Sarah buys Revivify, Dispel Magic, and both the Identify's
  - It's 360 GP
    - Sarah: "I'm under orders from Seliph, just put it on my tab"
    - The store owner doesn't keep tabs
    - Sarah doesn't have enough GP on her
    - Sarah shows the letter Seliph is sending to Lady Novis with the seal, store owner lets Sarah buy all four spells for 100 GP and then tell Seliph to pay him back within the month
  - One Identify is worth 90 GP
- Magnifying glass (looks like it's warping space around it)
- Hammer and nail sticking out of the bottom of the handle, glowing blue and purple
  - All we know is that it's glowing
  - He whacks something with the hammer, and it's just a hammer with a nail holder
  - It's just a hammer with glowing paint
- Has a tiny little lucky cat that waves its arm
- Potions on the wall, handcrafted by the shop keeper
  - Shopkeeper: My attempt at Restoration Potions (not as good as typical fare)
    - Tested it on myself, drank it, felt a little bit better
  - The first two over here make you go a little bit faster, it made me feel like I was going a bit faster
    - Haste?
  - These three gave me the power to slow down time, everything was moving in slow mo
  - On the bottom, these ones are my favorite, they're fruit flavored (some hints of strawberry)
    - What do they do? I don't know exactly
    - I feel like I pick up on things a little bit better, there's a lot of subtle flavors, the more I drink the more I can taste each individual flavor
- Bloo buys all 5 fruit-flavored potions for 2 gold and 5 silver pieces
- Sarah casts Identify on Banana
  - Banana doesn't notice Sarah touching her for a full minute
  - There is currently no spell active affecting Banana
  - There is a magical core that reeks of necromancy magic, but it's not active, it's an _object_
  - Now that you're aware of its presence, you can feel some sort of evil from that object (worn/equipped)
    - Supplementing the heart apparently
- Bloo drinks a potion right now
  - Bloo looks around, see a lot of facial expressions in Sarah (like wtf?) while Yul is blissfully unaware
  - Notice a backroom with cauldron and mortar and pestle, hanging torch, sees a backroom with no light, sees nothing off about the shop
  - As the effect fades off, Bloo gets a temp +1 to passive perception for 1 hour
  - Taste: 4 strawberries to 3 drops of lemon, a bit of melon flavor, slightly more sweet, a little bit of pineapple, other sweetness from other berries as well
- Sarah uses Identify on the glowing green amulet
  - See the amulet is a little bit bigger than it feels like it is
  - It appears to open, inside is a piece of parchment, and the item that's causing the glow and illusion magic is on the inside of the core
  - By the trim, you can open the trim and you can unclip the amulet
  - It's been concealed by the bright glow
  - Inside is a parchment and a green fish crystal (same as the other fish crystal) ^bf0c60
    - The glow fades
    - The parchment is a location, part of a map
    - Has a port, don't know where, but it looks like a region not in Fusilla
    - Recognizes a city, **Windrest in southeastern Dagdra**, outskirts, Nim has been there
    - There's a notable small college in this area, most of the town is aquatic, port city, know that there is something weird from the last time you were there, gave a talk at Windrest College
    - The map is leading towards an area near the water that Nim thought was supicious, but couldn't explore
    - Place listed as places to visit again and investigate by Nim
- Sarah has determined that Banana has a parasite that's not an entity, that's an orb of some sort, there's an evil orb inside Banana, proposes a "very simple" process, in Sarah's possession she has a scroll of Revivify, she can get rid of it and can improve Banana's situation
  - Simply, we kill and revive Banana
- The other way we'll need Lady Novis
