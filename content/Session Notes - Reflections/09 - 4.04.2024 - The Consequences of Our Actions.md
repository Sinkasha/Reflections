##### Important Points

- Tripped up and stole from 3 goblins in a trench coat who were bothering [[Characters/NPCs/Derrick Fiskov]], the weapon shopkeeper
  - Stole a key with the Fusillan flag, teleport scroll, and some gems
  - The 3 goblins gave Derrick a fake [[Guilds/The League of Larcenists\|LoL]] calling card
- Learned of a rumor that LoL is going to attack Parli, causing a lot of imitation leagues to show up
- The Fusillan flag key unlocks a vault in Parli, which requires 2 keys, one of which was entrusted to the [[Faltera/Fusilla/The Kingdom of Fusilla#Fiskov Family\|Fiskov]] family
- Derrick is cursed and stabs himself as a result, and then Sarah cures him
- Derrick joins the party, looking for his sister, who lost this important silver key and may be in danger
- We travel to Parli
- Find a cave with a buried treasure chest, find a blank note inside, illusion magic
- Then attacked by the adopted son of Count Canonbury, [[Characters/NPCs/Jeice]] and [[Characters/NPCs/Petra von Alspar]], members of the LoL
  - It appears the LoL stole from the Count and the Count doesn't work for the League
  - The LoL wants fish crystals
  - Jeice and Petra both warp away before we can kill them, but they drop a card with the LoL callsign and the fish emblem on it that simply says "The Order will Prevail", as well as a [[Miscellaneous/The Fish Crystals\|yellow fish]]

  - In the room see a lot of papers, there's a note in his hands that's been used to soak up the blood, leaning against a cabinet
    - Detected thoughts: Something magical compelled him to do this, to insert something into his body, not to kill himself

  - Shopkeeper: "I hope you realize you have a very important job, please return that key to Parli"
  - Bloo: "Why"
  - Shopkeeper: "It's not in the hands of someone it's entrusted", I am a Fiskov, [[Characters/NPCs/Derrick Fiskov]], which means there's been a breach of security

  - Derrick has a sister, [[Characters/NPCs/Fae Fiskov]], and a cousin [[Characters/NPCs/Melina Fiskov]]

  - Shorter than me, older sister, dresses nice, brunette, elf
  - Nim: "who was demanding money"
  - Shopkeeper: "hell if I know, they kept telling me they know who you are, they know who you looked for"
  - Bloo: "why did you stab yourself" (know from Detect Thoughts)
