# God
## Session 10
##### TLDR
- We fought this tiefling dude. 
- Got a massive lore drop about Nyarlathotep
- Involved PCs:
	- [[Yul]]
	- [[Nim]]
	- [[Sarah]]
	- [[Bloo]]
	- [[Lyra]]
- Previous session: [[09 - 4.04.2024 - The Consequences of Our Actions]] 
##### Past
- Learned of a rumor that the League of Larcenists is going to attack Parli. 
- Found a side quest: Derrick Fiskov (the weapons storeowner) has joined the party. He's looking for his sister, who lost this important silver key and may be in danger. This important silver key opens a safe in the castle of Parli, and was entrusted to the Fiskov family, an important family from the Empire of Dagdra. 
- Got attacked oops: The adopted son of Count Canonbury, Jeice, and Petra, members of the League of Larcenists, attacked us asking for the fish crystals back. We defeated them and they proceeded to drop another fish crystal. The traffic light fish crystal collection is complete yippee
- Also found some buried treasure with some notes that have illusion magic on them so we can't see what it says. 
- We are now level 5
##### Important Points
- The blank buried note says "Rendezvous in Parli in 4 days"
- On the way to Parli, we run into a depiction of the murder of apostles of [[Religion of Faltera#God of Death Nyarlathotep|Nyarlathotep]]
	- The 3 goblins were sacrificed
	- This is [[Tiefling Dude]]
	- He believes Nyarlathotep is still with us, not depreciated
	- He was sent to clean up after Jeice and Petra's mess
	- He approaches Yul and says "I know you're in there, now come with me and we can make this easy" and tells her to "return to your original form"
	- He says if Yul wants answers to meet him at Novis Lake
- Nim lore dumps: 
	- At [[The Empire of Dagdra#Crescent Grove|Crescent Grove]], Nim broke a seal and freed Yul, who appeared to be sealed voluntarily
	- [[The Council of Archmages]] appeared to have sealed Yul, has other temples 
	- Nyarlathotep is the ancient god of death, worship of him died out about 400 years ago because N. tried to fight the then [[Religion of Faltera#God of Life Genesis|God of Life]]
	- The God of Life's worshippers killed N's worshippers
	- God of Life worshippers sealed N's avatar into [[The Mirror of Enveloping Darkness]]
	- Those who look in the mirror become a vessel for the return of N
	- N's followers trying to find a vessel, failed vessels result in imperfect gnolls
	- N's worshippers are mostly in modern day Odema and Bereyth territory in Dagdra
	- [[Duessel Sarde]] likely descendent of clan that worshipped N, N tried to possess him, causing [[213 CE - The Falteran Massacre]]
	- Duessel's corpse was found, confirmed dead
	- [[The Council of Archmages]] shattered the mirror to prevent N from escaping, shard locations unknown
	- Theory: because of N, different dimensions borders are breached, Falteran Massacre caused by breach of Shadowfell, portals may be intersection of Fae Wild and Material Plane, they're getting smushed together, Shadowfell intersects up while Fae Wild smushes down
	- [[Grimnir]] may be cause of portals
	- The Far Realms may also be intersecting with the Outer Plane, which is *bad*
	- Mirror in count's house was portal to somewhere that projected the mindscape (not astral plane)
	- Theory: N sent avatar (willing worshipper) to material plane, N's power breaches border between planes
- Apparently Bloo woke up near Geimshall Woods in Fusilla and may have met Duessel in their past life and didn't like him
### On the Way to [[The Kingdom of Fusilla#Parli|Parli]]
- Bloo gives Yul a jar. Yul gets sand from the chest. She gets 4 oz. of sand. 
- People don't want to buy [[The Fish Crystals]]. 
- Sarah gives the blank note to Yul, who casts Dispel Magic on it
	- See that the weathered paper starts to glow, and see a swirl of parchment colored ink swirling into an orb shape, and poofing
	- See weird symbols on the note
	- Written in thief's cant, "Rendezvous in Parli in 4 days"
	- The paper is less than a week old
- Yul is eating sand. It hurts her teeth. 
	- Sarah: "This is extremely helpful to my goal."
	- Yul eats more sand. 
- Mar mends the carriage. 
- We travel to Parli. Sarah is riding beside the carriage on her horse. 
- Nim asks [[Derrick Fiskov]] about the fish crystals and cults
	- [[Melina Fiskov]] went to [[The Empire of Dagdra#Windrest|Windrest]] a fair bit, sent to protect people, typical missions
- Sarah asks Derrick to post to adventurer's guild on our behalf, we can talk about the terms later
	- Derrick: I am open to doing so, but there's a posting fee, as long as you're willing to pay for it…
- Carriage goes for about an hour, suddenly the horses stop because of the smell of blood
- Nim pokes her head out the carriage, see a short ways away to the right
	- Sees tall figure, not facing us, holding something in his hands, about 200 feet away
	- Flat terrain, piles of rock, up ahead see taller hills and some scaffolding in the distance, mostly stone and gravel, no dirt
	- Derrick peeps his head: "who is that"
- Nim tells us all to get out, Yul and Derrick stay in the carriage
	- Sarah: "Who tf are you"
	- No response
	- As Sarah gets closer, sees tattered cloth and shoes instead of rocks
	- Don't see a full body, see three sets of legs, small green, and there's a ripped trenchcoat, also a battered body of the halfling, one of the other men with the goblin
- Nim and Bloo walks a bit closer, we are 60 feet away
	- Nim concludes that the way the bodies are cut off don't resemble any ritual offering, but resemble depictions of the murder of apostles of a particular worshipped figure that is no longer worshipped, it is an older worshipped god of death, [[Religion of Faltera#Nyarlathotep|Nyarlathotep]]
	- The tall thing is a person, not the god, not the elf nor is it an elf
	- They are wearing formal wear, aristocratic wear, and shoulder cape, mostly black and red undertones
	- He is holding a long long sword that has it's sheath on
- Nim: "are you gonna throw a javelin at this one too"
- Sarah: "This one seems a little scary"
- Bloo approaches, Nim and Sarah watches
	- Deep male voice: "Don't come any closer"
	- Bloo attempts to Detect Thoughts
	- Takes 2 psychic damage and brain goes static-y
- Sarah approaches on her horse, hear his voice "Don't come any closer"
	- He sounds very dead inside
- Lyra walks closer
- Nim: "It's interesting that you worship a god that's depreciated"
	- Dude: "Interesting that you phrase it that way when he's still with us"
	- Nim: "No one really likes him anymore"
	- Dude: "I disagree"
- Sarah approaches closer
- Figure turns around, a flash of light of blade as he does a swift 180 and immediately re-sheaths his katana
	- Bloo dodges
	- Sarah isn't able to dodge cause of the horse
	- The blade isn't actually 30 feet long but the blade is absurdly long (from ground to eye level of a tall dude), does magical slashing damage
- See a blank looking expression that looks like pathetic indifference, his skin is purplish blue, he's a Tiefling, the hood that he has flew off, and he has two kind of hidden horns, his left eye isn't scarred but there are some markings on his left eye, black
![[Tiefling Dude's Eye.png|300]]
- Tiefling: "Are you sure that this god is not dead."
- Sarah and Nim have a slightly theological debate over dead gods
- Tiefling: "Popularity does not matter to me"
- Tiefling: "How are Jeice and Petra? I was sent to clean up after their mess"
	- He's from the [[The League of Larcenists]]??
- Sarah casts Detect Magic
	- Tiefling scoffs
	- Sarah detects Conjuration magic from his sword
- Nim: Minor Illusion on self to hide fish glow
- Sarah casts Dispel Magic on the sword
	- Can't, feel as if something is warding against magical attacks on the sword
	- Has an anti-magic property to it
- It's not a recreation, he's killing them in the same fashion as followers of N
	- Apostles of that god could still be alive
- Nim: "Are you the new reign of apostles"
	- Dude: juts backward and unsheathes his sword
	- Dude side stabs and then drags down, and a rift opens
	- Dude: "I have no time for this" and he hops into the rift which immediately closes
- See a flash of light behind us from the carriage, he emerges right next to the carriage
- Sarah immediately starts moving back, Yul tries to get the horses to move, and the hinge that keeps the reins snaps
- Nim and Bloo run back, Lyra jogs back
- Yul hears a demonic voice in her head and a strong pain in her chest
	- Tiefling: "I know you're in there, now come with me and we can make this easy"
	- Yul starts teabagging
	- Sarah approaches
	- Tiefling: "Fine then meet me in Lake Novis"
	- Yul casts Hold Person, Sarah silvery barbs, and the Tiefling is caught
- Sarah moves towards him and smites him twice
- Bloo moves over and Lightning bolts him (and Sarah) and then Mind slivers (he's immune to psychic damage and nat 20s his save)
- Nim sneaks attacks with bow but misses
- Lyra casts Firebolt, it hits, and then Chromatic orbs, thunder orb
- Yul's head is starting to feel fuzzy, chest is throbbing, she is emitting a dark flash of light from the middle of the chest, and then turns into light, hear voices in head screaming at her
	- The voices are saying "return to your original form"
	- Strong pulsating feeling in her chest
	- Yul fails Hold Person
	- Yul can only feel sharp and intense pain, feels very magical
	- Hear stronger voices that are getting fuzzier, "return return return"
- Tiefling has katana in head, provokes opportunity attack from Sarah by attempting to phase back, Sarah smites, Tiefling takes his sword and creates a rift, 
	- Tiefling: "Meet me in Lake Novis if you want answers, puppet" at Yul
	- Sarah casts lesser restoration on Yul
	- Yul is no longer feeling the voices as hard, as the thing in her chest stops glowing as strongly, and Yul comes to
- Mar mends the wagon and we go on our merry way
### Lore Dump
- The Far Realms exist, Sarah knows little about the dead god N, only Nim knows about him because she's a scholar
##### Crescent Grove Yul and Nim Stuff
- Nim was dicking around in a old ruin in [[The Empire of Dagdra#Crescent Grove|Crescent Grove]] in Dagdra, and Nim found a seal and broke the seal and found Yul
	- The seal was used to seal away really strong things
	- Yul being sealed *appears* to be voluntary
	- Removing/destroying the orb in her chest is likely not as simple as it seems 
- Crescent Grove is some unknown ruin, Council of archmages has structures like this
	- A temple (different types) in Frostwind, [[The Kingdom of Fusilla#Ridgepeak|Ridgepeak]], Nested Grove (near Windrest), Crescent Grove but all by the council
	- The council doesn't want Nim telling ppl this
##### Nyarlathotep Lore Dump
- N is the ancient god of death, controlling passage into the astral plane
- ~400 years ago, worship of N died out because N picked a fight with the other gods
	- N was trying to gain the power over life and death itself
	- One of his major opponents was the God of Life
	- God of life, worshippers in frostwind, heretia, and northern regions and stretching into fusilla
- All the other gods' worshippers killed N's worshippers (as is what happens when gods fight)
- [[The Mirror of Enveloping Darkness]] is theorized as a vessel for Nyarlathotep's avatar
	- History records claim the mirror was created in 212
	- It was discovered sealed by Odemian mages and who unsealed it, unaware of its original purpose
- Worshippers of N's enemy, the God of Life, sealed N's avatar into the mirror
	- Trying to keep the spirit of Nyarlathotep trapped and in a limbo in the mirror
- People who look in mirror become vessel for the return of Nyarlathotep
	- N's followers trying to find a vessel, N trying to possess a vessel that he could use, failed vessels results in imperfect gnolls (hyenas that turned into demons) 
		- God in charge of gnolls, yeenoghu, N killed him and took his power of gnolls
- Nyarlathotep is an ancient god, is an Elder Evil (ish?)
- N's worshippers are mostly in modern day Odema and Bereyth territory in Dagdra
##### Duessel Sarde Lore Dump 
- Duessel is possibly a descendent of the clan that worshipped N
- Duessel looked in the mirror, and N tried to possess him, leading to Duessel and the [[213 CE - The Falteran Massacre]]
	- Causes Falteran massacre (before Dagdran independence), this was part of war of independence
- No one saw the people who killed him again
- Duessel's corpse was found and confirmed dead
##### Mirror Lore Dump
- The Mirror was thought to be created by wicked mages, but it's actually a seal for N's avatar
- [[215 CE - The Council of Archmages is Formed]] council shatters the mirror to prevent N from escaping, locations of the shards are unknown
- Lady Novis is one of the founders of the Council
- Mirror exists before written history (mages and academia suppressing this knowledge)
- 2 mages from odemian gov. **allegedly** create mirror
- 1 year later, presented as gift to the revolution

##### DnD World Stuff
Fae Wild
Material Plane
Shadowfell
- There was likely a breach of shadowfell at Thalanrod during [[213 CE - The Falteran Massacre]]
- Nim theory: pockets of Fae Wild and interplanar expansion (random ass portals) would be a result caused by imbalance of N's resurgence
	- N's resurgence as his religion picks up again causing interplanar problems
	- Theorize there's a dimensional rift in the Overdark that's expanding
- Grimnir has been theorized as the cause of portals and he lives in Thalanrod
- The portals may be the intersection of the Fae Wild and Material Plane
- Theory: because of N, breach between walls of diff. dimensions (ie. portals between Material Plane and Fae Wild)
	- Material Plane and Fae Wild is getting smushed (it's a pancake)
	- Shadowfell is probably also intersecting upwards while Fae Wild is smushing down
	- The Far Realms may also be intersecting with the Outer Plane, which is *bad*
##### Random Stuff
- The Fiskovs are from Fusilla and Melina moved to Dagdra (clearing up a misunderstanding)
- Political faction in Dagdra that hates Fusilla exists
- Mirror in count's house was portal to somewhere that projected the mindscape (not astral plane)
##### Sarah's Theory
- N is from Far Realms
- Breach cause N resurge, Far realms breaching outer plane, which is really bad
- N sent avatar to material plane
- Avatar is a willing worshipper of N, allowing  N to project into them 
- Overdark is breach of shadowfell (theory assume)
- N's power extends to breaching border between planes
	- Astral plane is bridge between far realms and outer planes
	- N's avatar is trapped in material plane, he himself is in the Far Realms
	- Mages sealed N in mirror, N wants to get out, N tries to possess ppl who looks in the mirror (enveloping darkness) 
	- Some of the avatar possessed Duessel, part of it, mostly in the mirror
##### More Stuff
- Tiefling who worships N is somewhat affiliated with League/fish
- Parli may have a mirror shard in the vault cause tiefling going after the goblins who *had* key
- Banana has core of shadowfell?? cause dark flash 
- Edwin → found in pocket dimension
- The mages that sealed N are different from archmages, and they're from Odema, the holy state
	- Commonly believed that mirror was created in 212 but probably created ages ago, council of archmages created in 215, as a means of "oh shit we need to fix the mirror thing"
	- Mages, who presented mirror to duessel, were from odema who kept it safe
- Worshippers of the god of life sealed N's avatar in the mirror, sealed for ages
	- The glass that sealed the avatar was turned into a mirror, made more presentable
- N's worshippers were from the holy state, but have since not worshipped N, primarily worship currently popular the gods of sun, fortune, order
- Crescent Grove was connected to the archmages, about 130 year old ruins, mostly forgotten about, getting in wasn't hard for Nim, but the seal Nim broke and releasing Yul had iconography from council of archmages, and council of archmages is known to be secretive
- Yul was in a crystal bubble, looked as if it was to keep Yul there, didn't look like she was captive, just containment
- Lady Novis was one of the founders of the council of archmages
##### Other Random Stuff / Repeat of existing stuff
- After Dagdra becomes independent, Council is formed in Parli with mirror and they shatter it
- [[Sanctum Key]] has a pattern on it that's vaguely fish-like, map of Windrest is connected to Fish
- Goblin scroll thing is likely a teleportation circle but doesn't know where it teleports to ^0e1bdf
- Nim broke seal that was at it's time limit, by the council of archmages, the building was already there, and then the seal
	- Yul looks suspended animation, not a room of worship, closer to a prison cell, containment area, had crystal in it, Yul was suspended in crystal
	- May have been sequestered (7th level spell), this spell requires consent
- Alvar is like Canonbury but forested, and much larger, bigger mountains, rivers in the back, dense forests surrounding it
- Both N worshippers in odema and Beryth region
- Pockets of Fae Wild → portals that lead to Fae Wild, general merging of the planes
### Next Camp Site, Sun Down
- Relatively flat area, see bit of an encampment, approaching area, see old wooden fortress, looks like old and depreciated goblin outpost, old campfire pit in it
- Yul no longer has voices in her head
	- Says the voices sound familiar but dunno what it is
	- Did not feel compelled to listen to them
- We walk in
	- Tree house structure 
- Nim opens door, instantly sees a chest, Lyra right behind 
- Note on chest: "hello travelers en route to or from Parli, please take something or leave something"

- Lyra finds a sack of marshmallows
- There's also sticks in there recently cleaned
- Nothing fish-shaped in the chest, but there is a fish in the chest in a bag of ice

- Left hut, see identical lil bed
- Area where horses can rest, lil stable
- More of an upkept community area
- Put horses in stable and feed them
- See metal fountain beside stable, it looks like it's been off, see a little switch, Nim flips the switch, the water shoots out and Nim dodges it, it becomes a little fountain
- Bloo casts Light on the water, Lyra casts Dancing Lights, Sarah casts Light on the fountain, happy rave time!!!
	- We have smores
- Bloo cooks fish, perfectly charred fish, Bloo roasts the fish to perfection
- Sarah's primarily goal is removing curse, realizes that killing and reviving Yul isn't going to work
- Sarah is still here because she wants to remove all the curses inflicting this group

- Curses inflicted by vengeful deities that Sarah hates 
- Lyra is here for the crimes.
- Apparently Bloo woke up near Geimshall Woods in Fusilla
