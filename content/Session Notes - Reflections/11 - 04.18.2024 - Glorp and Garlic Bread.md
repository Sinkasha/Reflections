	- Dude opens fist to show orange [[Miscellaneous/The Fish Crystals\|fish crystal]]
	- Dude: "I'm trying to return the fish to someone, but also stole the fish from someone"
		- He's trying to return the fish to whomever the league stole it from
	- Sarah: "i've been collecting them, I have 7"
	- Dude: "There's only 7"
	- Sarah: "People keep stealing my fish >:|"
	- Dude: "Do you understand the significance of this fish"
	- The party walks in at this point
	- Bloo reads his mind: 
		- Dude thought: "This paladin might be part of the league, idk why this person is trying to claim the owner of the crystal"
	- Nim leans over and quietly whispers in his ear "The order shall prevail"
		- Dude thought: "SHITSHITSHITSHITSHIT" and runs and Sarah grabs him by the nape

	- Hugo: [[Characters/NPCs/The Order of the Fish]] is a political faction based in Windrest and I had a bit of a run in with a couple operators in the League because I managed to snatch the orange fish crystal
	- Hugo: The Order is a purely political operation that hires the League
	- Hugo: The League is self-serving, according to some notes, it appears the League is a front for a particular wing of the political Order
	- Hugo: The order blames Fusilla for the assassination of emperor beryth, however, from what I've heard, it was the Order that assassinated the order, it was an inside job, and they wanted this as an excuse after Duessel was subjugated and independent Dagdra, they wanted Dagdra to conquer the rest of the continent
	- Hugo: The League is going to attack Parli, the Queen is in an unknown safe location right now
	- Hugo: The fish crystals, I believe, are keys, I'm blacklisted from the country of Dagdra cause I've been getting threats from the Order for a long time now

	- Nim: "Have you heard of N"
	- Hugo: "Yeah"
	- Nim: "Have you heard anything interesting about it"
	- Hugo: "Personally no, the tall slender man was the most recent instance of that"
	- Hugo: Upper ranks of the Order have markings on their face
	- Hugo got the crystal at [[Faltera/Fusilla/The Kingdom of Fusilla#Everholden\|Everholden]] 
	- Hugo: Tiefling is from Order, and the Order follows N, the League might just be a front, not many people survive encounters with them, the League is either employed or part of the Order
	- Hugo sketches out markings of the man who he stole the fish from : [[Characters/NPCs/Dude 2]]
	- ![[Images/Dude 2's Eye.png|300]]
	- [[Miscellaneous/The Fish Crystals]]
	- Nim: "What other colors"
	- Hugo: "seven colors of the spectrum"
	- Nim: "Why rainbow colored, connected to god of death??"
	- Hugo: "Well, from very vague things I know, N trying to usurp the power of the original progenitor power"
	- Hugo: "Idk exact iconography, I do know there are 7"
	- Nim: "The orange one is my fourth"
	- Hugo: "Damn, is that why I'm feeling a weird aura from Yul"
	- Nim: "I found Yul in ruins"
	- Hugo: "OH? " pulls out notebook and asks Yul how she's feeling thru the window
	- Hugo: Frostdir, my supervisor, told me that he worked with Lady Novis on something about keeping a seal intact, did you break said seal?
	- Nim: Why?
	- Hugo: "It's linked to the council of archmages"
	- Sarah: "We're "
	- Nim: "I propose we replace Derrick with Hugo"
	- Bloo: "No"
	- Nim: "Do you know what's in the vault in the castle"
	- Hugo: "I felt space distorted so I was running, I felt an urge to run"
	- Is the Duke with the Order?
	- Hugo: "everyone in fusilla is against the order"
	- Bloo: "Is there a coup"
	- Hugo: "Idk"
	- Hugo will travel with us
	- ANOTHER NPC ACQUIRED!
- Hugo needs to go see Frostdir, cause it's his supervisor
- Hugo: "Among you five, who do you trust the most to not lose things"
- Sarah: "Nim won't lose things, Nim will gain things"
- Hugo tosses a key to Nim, it's an ordinary key and it has text inscribed on it, with the number 307
- Hugo: "This is the place I'm staying, it's a really large room, I'm staying at the Hotel de Aqua", it's close the Rosalind District, it's blue on the outside, meant to look like the smaller version of the castle, if you need a place to crash, that hotel has large rooms
- It's about noon now, we cross the bridge to the Emerald district, we pass the library, it's a giant building that looks like it's made of glass but it's sturdier, it's a special order, strength of steel but appearance of glass, a Fusillan specialty
- The Academy: Two towers, a bridge, and a gated stone tower fort looking thing with big courtyard
- Hugo: "My office is up this tower, it's gonna be several stairs"
- We walk into Hugo's office, lots of stacks of paper, sketches of summoning circles, Hugo rifles thru some papers, now I need to meet with Frostdir, he's down the hall
- We walk into another office, see students in courtyards casting spells, see people dropping their spell books, open door, and greeted with tall elf man ([[Characters/NPCs/Horace Frostdir]])
  - Frostdir has never seen this circle in his life
  - Frostdir: IDK any of who you are
  - Frostdir: stares and looks at Lyra, and Bloo, and Yul
  - Frostdir: Seliph warned me about you, you're Sarah aren't you
  - Frostdir: I need to read Hugo's report
  - Hugo hands him some papers
  - Frostdir: So all of you probs have lots of questions, no I will not write any letters of rec
  - Frostdir: The cursed one is stupid, just as Lady Novis told us
  - Frostdir: Idk all the details, lemme guess was this the thing sealed in crescent grove
  - Frostdir: I should hope you know that Lady Novis put her there in the first place
  - Frostdir: Why? I suspect that Sarah is nosy and already cast Identify on her?
  - Frostdir: I imagine you seek audience with Lady Novis, you do not get accepted automatically, ANYWAYS,
  - Frostdir: You've seen, he starts pointing towards Yul, and an object starts glowing in her chest
  - Frostdir: Do you know about the mirror? Do you know where the shards are hidden?
  - Frostdir: There's two shards in Parli, one in Vault, one in Yul???!?!?!!!!!?!!
  - Frostdir: The other shards are not in people
  - Frostdir: I can't grant you memories of before you were sealed, she voluntarily accepted the shard and was sealed away, but idk her prior, but I am quite young compared to Lady Novis, you gotta ask Lady Novis, one of the shards resides in you, young puppet
  - Frostdir: You decided voluntarily, puppet, to be sealed
  - Sarah: What's the deal with the Count?
  - Frostdir: I heard he's dead thank god, Oh he was doing that mirror shit again?
  - Frostdir: Long story short, the [[Characters/NPCs/Count Canonbury]] was once a student of the magic academy trying to become a legendary inventor, tried to recreate the mirror, he worked as a scientist for the order of the fish, i heard a group of adventurers hired by Seliph took him out
  - Frostdir: Didn't want to tarnish name, so hired adventurers
  - Frostdir: Please take a seat, _a bunch of chairs drifts in_ would you like some tea?
  - A little mage hand brings the tea to us
  - Frostdir: You have four of them right
  - Nim: yes, we met the three goblins in the trench coat
  - Frostdir looks at the vault key from Nim
  - Frostdir: So this is a fake, I just talked to Fae yesterday, Fae is fine I was with her this morning
  - Frostdir: [[Characters/NPCs/Petra von Alspar]] is not affiliated with this academy,, you might be describing Petra von Alspar, she's a daughter of a noble over in some region in Dagdra
  - Frostdir: As you can tell, the Order and the League have a wide influence
  - Frostdir: Where'd you get the teleportation circle
  - Nim: The goblins
  - We need to find DERRICK AAHHH
  - Frostdir puts a ring on his finger, we follow him, he pulls a curtain, "alright watch this"
    - His ring starts to glow
    - See Frostdir's eyes glows as well, and you see something flash over there, he hasn't gotten terribly far, he doesn't know how to go the castle, he's surprisingly near the library
    - Sarah goes to get him
  - Frostdir tells Yul to stay, "I have some questions"
  - Frostdir: "Uhm, idk how to get your memory back, but I'm pretty sure Lady Novis does, interesting patchwork"
  - Frostdir: The League has not struck yet, but I'm aware of their presence
  - [[Religion of Faltera#God of Death Nyarlathotep]]
  - Nim: Where is the sanctuary in Windrest?
  - Frostdir: You ran into Petra and Jeice
  - Nim: They teleported away
  - Frostdir: That gauntlet was something the Count worked on, the gauntlet amplifies Jeice's magic, [[Characters/NPCs/Jeice]] failed magic school, so I assume if he was able to use any magic, it was because of the gauntlet
  - Frostdir: Well that means his patron is something more powerful than the Order, someone that does actually worship Nyarlathotep, I presume that gauntlet uses stones pre-infused with magic, that teleport circle may teleport somewhere
  - Frostdir: I didn't think those swords exist, [[Characters/NPCs/Tiefling Dude]]'s sword, Hugo would you like to explain
  - Hugo: You're describing sword that can cut fabric space time, Legend had it that there was a blacksmith that infused the properties of space itself into a few blades, idk how many there are in existence, no more than three (Bloo has seen two, Edwin and tiefling dude)
  - Bloo, explaining Edwin, didn't get stabbed in _this_ body
  - Frostdir: "OH?"
  - Frostdir: Lady Novis should be the one to answer that, she's currently busy, first thing tomorrow morning, would you like to meet her? I can teleport her to you
  - Bloo: TIEFLING GUY SAID TO MEET AT LAKE NOVIS
  - Frostdir: oh no
  - Frostdir: there's gonna be an attack and we need to defend
  - Frostdir: Puppet…
  - Nim: That's rude
  - Frostdir: Alright, this changes things
  - Frostdir: Lady novis will probs trying to extract shard from her
  - Frostdir: If I was gonna extract shard from Yul I'd probably kill her then revive her
- SARAH
  - Sarah finds Derrick in a panic
  - Sarah gets him onto his horse
  - Takes him back towards the rest of the party
- OKAY BACK TO FROSTDIR
  - Frostdir: Oh hi welcome back, Derrick your sister is fine
  - Derrick: The key!?
  - Bloo: The key is fake
  - Derrick: !?!?!?
  - Frostdir: Yeaaah…, and hands written note to Derrick, just enter castle and buzz for her
  - Frostdir: A lot more to discuss, so I can summon lady novis, shall I send her a message?
  - Party: Yes
  - Frostdir: Wonderful, did the Tiefling mention when to meet
  - Frostdir: Let's just say Astrid has her defenses
  - Frostdir gives 5GP to Derrick, and tells her to get Fae a nice dinner
- As Frostdir sits down, he looks at Lyra, then looks back at his tea ^372512
- Bloo feels that Parli is familiar but cannot place it, has likely been to Parli pre-blob
