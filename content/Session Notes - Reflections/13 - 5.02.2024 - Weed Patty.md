### [[The Kingdom of Fusilla#Parli|Parli]]

- Apparently [[Astrid von Novis]] was holding back when showing us the time thing
- Lady: "See you in the morning" and dimension doors off
- [[Hugo Starling]] has questions in the morning
- We head back to hotel
- As we wake up, except Sarah is still in bed, in front of Sarah is a little mage hand, and it just boops her nose, and then pokes Sarah
- Astrid from behind the door goes "Good morning! Hugo told me you are staying here"
- Yul pokes at the mage hand with her plastic knife until it poofs
- Nim opens the door
  - Lady: "Good morning, I hope you're awake enough for training"
  - Lady: "I'm going to have you all- some of you- go have some fun"
  - Lady: "I brought some uniforms"
- Lady: "I trust that you are all decent spellcasters"
  - Sarah: "Well fuck you too"
- Lady: "I've reserved the training grounds, I'd like you all to practice a special type of magic that I came up with myself"
- Lady: "I'm pretty sure Hugo and [[Horace Frostdir]] have errands for you (Nim and Sarah)"
- Sarah: "That's really boring"
- Nim: "We have that teleportation scroll"
- Lady: "Safer as a group, no? Go waste Horace's time"
- Lady looks very excited
- Lady: "You two can come with"

- Lady: "Free pass to the dining hall for breakfast!"
  - Nim: "Yay!"

- Walk into Academy's courtyard, target
- Lady: "Hit those targets, I want to assess your aim"
- None of us have cantrips that can hit inanimate objects
- Her time spell was named Chronostasis
- Lady: Have you ever thought of making your own little pocket dimension
  - A manifestation of my own plane
  - If you use magic super strong, it can create its own pocket dimension
  - Seems like a plane in a plane
  - They say I'm not easy to follow, I'm not really good at teaching
  - I'm good at research
- Lady gives healing potion to Nim
- A bucket of water falls on Lyra when she gets back, Astrid shapes water to get it off
- Sarah: "Astrid knows how to cast Wildfire, a spell, it's free magic"
- Sarah: "How'd you learn this"
- Astrid: "Lots of rigorous training, and lots of doing whatever until it happens, I have a strong affinity for magic, friends up in the north, in Frostwind"
- Sarah: "Who specifically, I've lived in Frostwind"
- Astrid: "You remember Ellery? Through transference of a magical object, I learned mostly from a tome forged by Ellery, the tome is named Stasis"
  - Stasis is currently safeguarded in my castle
- Sarah: "Can I read it?"
- Astrid: "Idk what'd you find interesting"
- Astrid: "I at first could only cast specifically with that tome, and for the longest time it was the only thing I could cast"
  - The spell Astrid cast last night was similar to the spell she cast on Duessel when she died
- Astrid: "Yul goes first"
  - Sarah runs as far away as possible
  - Nim goes far
- Astrid: "Sarah come back!!"
- Astrid: "Yul come back"
  - She places her hand on Yul, she puts her hand on Yul's head, and the hand glows a bright red
  - Yul feels a strong course of magic go through Yul, very invigorating, feel the blood circulating, feel a lot warm
  - Astrid and Yul's eyes glow, as does Yul's core
  - Glowing a bright red
- Astrid: "stand about 10 feet away, anyone who's not in the blast radius might want to move out"
- Astrid goes up to Yul, pulls out a book, and tells Yul and "follow my lead"
  - Does hand symbol, channel your magic, and chant an incantation, and channel it towards Sarah
- See red emerging from Yul, blood like spiral, half sphere of blood emerge in a circle from Sarah, it's trying to close up, but it's failing to go very far
- Astrid: "Yul, stop if you can"
- As the red sphere attempts to crystallize around Sarah, it just stops
- Sarah pokes it, and it's crystallized blood, Sarah tastes the blood and immediately feels very sick for a brief second
- Sarah: "What the fuck is wrong with your blood" at Yul
- Astrid: "Do not ingest that"
- Astrid: "Why is your blood poisonous, Yul?"
- Yul releases the handsign
- Astrid: "Who wants to try next, idk what's up with Yul's blood"
- Lyra loses rock paper scissors, so Lyra goes next
- Astrid's hands glows purple, as Lyra's hair and earrings are purple
- Astrid: "I'm imbuing them with some magic"
- Sarah: "Who decides the colors, Astrid?"
- Lyra is glowing purple
- Astrid teaches Lyra a different hand sign
- Nim: "What do those handsigns mean???"
- Astrid: "I HAVE NO IDEA"
- The blood around Sarah decrystallized and is now a puddle of blood around Sarah
- Now around Sarah, fabric itself is distorting, as distortion flows around Sarah, it gets higher than where Yul got it, Sarah looks like she's surrounded by warped glass
- Nim throws a rock at the weird distorted space around Sarah
- The rock rolls in, and it gets bounced back forcefully and there are now cracks in the rock
- Astrid: "Cool, Lyra you can stop"
- Astrid, studies time, didn't want to be a diviner
- As this conversation happens, Horace walks in and gets a bucket of water dumped on him
- Horace: "Is this actually important, because we have just ascertained the location of the teleportation scroll (from goblin scroll). Hugo and I have been studying it"
- Horace: "Huh? Astrid?"
- Sarah: "Ler her cook"
- Bloo glows green, a mossy green
- In this green glow, see a very powerful figure silhouette of a human glowing around Bloo tortle
- See a white half sphere (bottom) emerge under Sarah, it's sort of solid, nothing is happening Sarah, it appears infinitely thin
- Nim throws a rock at it, there's a crack in the dome
- Sarah: "wtf does this do"
- Astrid: "Idk bro"
- Horace: "Are you trying to be mysterious and cool, Astrid"
- Horace: "She's teaching you a variant of barriers and pocket dimensions, we haven't really named it, we just call it barriers"
- Sarah: "You should just call it Wildfire"
- Horace: "We can just call it a Wildfire barrier"
- Astrid is trying to teach you to enclose a barrier inside a space to warp whoever is inside into a pocket dimension
- Anyways, teleportation circle
- Horace: "Astrid just has no friends, she just stays in her tower-" Astrid bonks him
- Astrid: "Horace can take you there and back"
- Nim: "Yeah you can get to know your daughter"
- Sarah: "We're gonna go directly to court so you can pay child support"
- Horace draws a teleportation circle
- Horace: "we've pinpointed that it should be somewhere near windrest, between windrest and nested grove route, hopefully we return by the end of the day"
- Horace opens the gate, everyone walk through it
- Horace glows white, opens teleportation circle
- Bloo and Nim skip through the portal together, arm in arm

### Teleportation Circle

- Emerge into a small room with a locked door, there is a teleportation circle at our feet
- Bloo casts light
- We are all cramped together
- Nim pulls out some lock picking tools, hear a click, and the door knob turns and it slowly creaks open
- The door opens into a large room, with some bookshelves, some lit torches, with two upper levels, no cobwebs
- See a locked door on the wall directly across from us, and there is a box in the corner of the opposite wall, the door has no handle
- Nim goes to the box, which is locked
- Nim picks the lock, and it opens, and there is some cotton padding, some cobwebs, see a little ring which appears to be made of brass
- Nim takes the ring, on it says "fixing all your problems", it's a Mending ring
- There are 6 torches, 3 of them are lit, also a few bookshelves
- Most of them are just classical literature, there are a few stories
- I found a book about a man who cannot cast any magic, called Harry Squatter, the boy who cannot cast money, self help book, book about indie jones
- Sarah: "Hey Horace look it's a book about you!"
  - Horace: "Bruh"
- The walls are made of stone bricks
- The floor straight above has a walkway
- Nim lights the other torches, all torches are lit and nothing happens
- Bloo misty steps to the walkway above, I see more doors, walkway is in shape of cross, I open a door with a mage hand, open into a small room with two small boxes
- Bloo mage hand opens one of the boxes, I see a torn up piece of paper with pattern of the scrolls
- I open the other box, it's just more paper with ink smeared around, I lift some with mage hand, I see one with legible writing, it's a vortex warp spell scroll
- Horace is awkwardly looking at Lyra trying to start a conversation
- Nim likes to leave, Lyra leaves
- Sarah tries to speak to Horace in Celestial
- Nim jumps up to the walkway with Bloo
- Bloo opens the opposite door on top walkway with mage hand, and there is just a long hallway
- Nim and Bloo walk down the hallway
- Sarah: becomes a therapist to Horace
- Horace: "Astrid really guilted me into coming back"
- Horace: "Lyra I can't make it up"
- Sarah: "1,000,000 gold would probably help"
- Lyra folds papers up into a burrito and looks at Horace: "burrito"
- Horace: "You do have quite the magical prowess"
- Lyra: "Yeah "
- Horace and Lyra have a little conversation
- While Sarah is a therapist
- Horace seems nervous
- Sarah and Lyra roll double nat 20s to deceive Horace into believing the amongus hand sign as the gang sign of [[Vasara Adventuring Company]]
  - Horace full-heartedly believes this
- Bloo and Nim go down the hallway, enter an even larger room
  - See several tables strewn about in a mess, see a glass screen partitioning the room in half, and a door through the glass
  - Very foggy and dark on the other side of the glass
- Bloo casts light on the glass, doesn't reveal anything
- On the tables, there are shards of glass on the table with some spilled liquid, seems relatively fresh, looks like water, the table is made out of weird metallic looking petrified wood
  - It's the tree from the [[The Kingdom of Fusilla#Geimshall Woods|Geimshall Woods]]
- Nim pokes the liquid with her drumstick, the drumstick that made contact with the liquid is completely gone
- Some of the tables have glitter floating around in the air, that used to be in a jar
- Nim and Bloo yell down and tell everyone to come up, Horace casts Fly on Lyra
- Everyone comes up
- Bloo brute forces the torch puzzle and opens the door
- All of us walks into the door
- Nim casts mending on the broken glass, glows pink, the bottle goes back into its original form, the liquid that was contained within is vwooped back in
  - It's a Klein bottle
  - Nim takes the klein bottle
- Bloo attempts to pour some of the liquid into the yogurt jar, and then after Horace and Sarah talks them out of it, I will just hold it with my mage hand
- Horace looks at glowy dust and goes "Oh no"
- Horace: "I believe this dust is similar to what's inside of those orbs in the Count's orbs" ^24e6b4
- Nim cannot cast mending on the dust
- The dust feels ethereal and Nim cannot scoop it up
- Bloo opens the door with Mage Hand, the smoke and gas escapes very rapidly and fills both sides of the glass, extremely difficult to see
- Sarah: tells Horace to cast Dispel Magic
- Horace dispels magic, hears a clunk in a different room, far away
- Horace: If this is connected to the order, our goal is to destroy their resources, but leave some of the remnants and artifacts to us so we can identify things
- Sarah walks into the room, see that there is a valve and it is painted red
- Sarah goes over and turns the valve, hear there is some noise from the other side of the glass, sounds like air escaping, little grates in the ground opens and air gets vacuumed out
- See writing on the wall on the other side of the glass, see a desk that has a piece of paper on it, which has the rest of the torch pattern on it, and a quill and a knocked over jar of ink
  - The ink is still a little wet
- The writing on the wall says "The Order will Prevail" and under it says "Recipe for orb"
- The desk has no papers on it anymore, but convenient shape where there was papers
- The space seems distorted around the desk
- Bloo sits at the chair, and feels a weird distortion that's correcting itself, space around desk is slowly inching its way back to normal from warped
- Horace attempts to make sense of it, "so the count came out of the orb"
- Horace: "From my understanding, this is odd, it was only one-way in, but the count has one that's one-way out"
- Horace recalls the Count spent some time in Dagdra, if we are truly in Dagdra, make sure that I'm not seen because it might seem like an interesting diplomatic mission
  - Just leave no witnesses
- There is a faint trace of dust and ink on the ground leading out
- Back to the top walkway area, the other two doors without handles have opened, one is a small room, and the other is a hallway / large room
- Another box, and the box is already opened, it's an empty box but it's tossed to the side, it looks like whatever opened it was in a hurry
- The other room is larger, see a few things, a round table in the shape of a U, luxurious table and a few chairs, there is a door on the other side that's slightly open, everything is made out of the petrified wood
  - Sarah carves something in the wood
- Nothing on the table of note
- Nim kicks the slightly open door all the way
- On the other side is a massive room
- There is a giant stream of wall of water as a left wall, and there are 7 pedestals in front of the wall of water, there is some ocean fish tank constructs on the side wall, the fish look like constructs, fountain in the middle, and there is three large round cylinders / holes in the wall
- See someone taking a blue fish crystal
  - Nim yells: "THAT'S MY FISH CRYSTAL"
- Dude is not someone we recognize, a copper dragonborn, has a tattoo under his eye
	- ![[Images/Mikhail Eye Marking.png|300]]
- Dude turns around puts blue fish crystal in pocket
- Sarah goes kind of far from us, Bloo casts invisibility and ends up near the fountain
- Bloo telepathically tells Nim to distract the dude
- Dude is holding a mace on his back
- Nim is yammering on about health and fish
- The Dude was supposed to retrieve the fish crystal, who gave you the order??
- Dude: I outrank Jeice
- Nim is yammering
- He takes orders from a guy named [[Theodore]]
- I attempt to swipe the fish crystal and rip his pocket off but I miss, and invisibility wears off
- Sarah: "What's your name"
- Mik short for [[Mikhail]]
- The room is 120 feet across and 60 feet wide
- Nim walks a bit closer and sneak attacks with her bow, hits
  - "I WANT THAT FUCKEN FISH"
  - Nim hides behind the fountain
- Mik pulls a small orb out of his pocket, club in right hand, orb in left hand
- Bloo attempts to catch the orb, dives and fails, the orb shatters and space distorts in my face, and a ripple of distortion spreads out over the entire room
  - A few things vwoop out
  - Two weird looking aberrations, two chokers pop out
- Bloo is prone
- Mik attempts to slam down with the mace, Sarah silvery barbs and Mik misses
- Lyra fires a lightning Chromatic Orb at Mik, and misses, hits the water, but hits one of the chokers half in the water
- Horace lightning bolts Bloo and Mik, hits both
  - Horace pats Lyra's back and does the amogus symbol
- Sarah: abjure enemy, oath, makes the chokers move as far away as possible and can't take actions, one in corner is climbing on the walls
- Bloo: gets up, shoves Mik in water, lightning bolt along the water where Mik and 2 chokers have lined up, and lightning bolts electrocutes everyone
- The entire sheet of water is charged
- Bloo triple kills
- Bloo gets the blue fish crystal and gives it to Nim
- Bloo loots the body, choker corpses are still there
- Sarah cuts off the choker hands and keeps it
- Another small orb in his pocket, his club is also shining a little, it's magical, notice something interesting about the club, the base has a weirdly small handle
- Twist the handle, open and inside the club is a couple of gems, fall out, some powdered rubies spill out, two rubies of about 25GP, bloo screws it back together
- Find a key and a note
  - Note: signed Theodore, "says retrieve all remaining crystals in the pedestal, the ritual should not be initiated until further notice" ← Nim has it
  - All the other pedestals are empty, notice that the indents rotate
  - The key looks like a bucktooth key, seems to be iron
  - Key to lock not door
- Horace gives Bloo a strawberry yogurt of healing
  - Bloo eats it
