### The Vault
- The buttons no worky
- A veil of light goes straight up at the pedestal, and the roof opens up
- There's a warm yellow light
- Nim throws an orange up into the light, it slowly floats up
- Nim floats up and away
- Nim lands, the orange is at her feet, she picks it up
- You see a button, the light turns blue, the beam causes Yul to float down
- A door opens in the room below, the wall 
- Bloo presses the button again, nothing happens
- There's engravings in the button room, one is written in dwarvish, and the other is in elvish
	- Dwarvish: In the halls of the sanctum, we store those treasures that we have utilized
	- Elvish (right): to my lovely Allie, I apologize, I cannot face you again, until that day then comes, I leave these in rest
	- Seems to be a relatively sad looking mural behind the elvish inscription, a tall figure carrying someone, but a limp body, purely artistic
	- Dark elves, drow
	- A fancy looking bow in the painting, silhouette, an arrow, and a net, above the elvish
	- The bow is Horizon, by [[Ellery Woddlespin]]
	- Above the dwarvish: a teardrop, and two circles on both sides of it
- Next to the button, a part of the wall looks worse for wear next to the button
- Bottom floor: opens up in hallway with Yul and Lyra
- Wooden door at the end, Yul rolls up to the wooden door
- Yul knocks three times, no response
- Yul knocks so hard the door swings open, and can't see anything in front of the door, it's magical darkness
- Yul tosses a banana into the room, nothing happens to the banana, you can hear it land
- Nim takes a pickaxe to the bit next to the button, collapsing the wall and it crumbles
- A splash of acid, a fire bolt, and a ray of cold sprays out from behind it, Nim dodges it
- Standing in there is a automaton
- See a zone of red from the automaton, bloo and nim step to the side
- There's something sparkly behind the automaton
- Bloo picks Nim up, and jiggles her out from behind cover
- Nim throws the orange and misses, see flashes of orange and mess, see shards of orange peel flying out, smells like hot orange juice
- Bloo jiggles Nim around, Nim shoots a mage hand, and grabs the thing, it's a doorknob
- Nim opens the door, see two buttons
- A faint cheer of buttons from Bloo and Nim
- Sarah catches up with Yul and Lyra
- Yul grabs the banana
- Sarah can see the sign with markings on it, the bow and the net, left is bow right is net
- Yul casts Dispel Magic on the darkness, fails
- Yul ties a rope to Sarah
- Sarah keeps walking
- Walks a bit further, see another set of signs, teardrop on left, arrow on right
- See another crevice in front
- Each crevice could fit a person in it
- Nim presses the left button, the left circle to the teardrop is glowing white
- The teardrop downstairs is glowing (but no one knows)
- The automaton is smoking, it has robotic arms and there's fire prepped 
	- Bloo peeks Nim out again
	- Nim: "PULL ME BACK PULL ME BACK"
	- Fire blows out from the hallway
- Nim presses the right button
	- Sarah hears an explosion upstairs
	- The right circle to the teardrop glowing white now
	- Sarah sees rubble land in front of her between her and the sign in front
- Nim hears a constant ringing in her ears, bloo is muffled
- There's a lot of smoke, the automaton blew up
- The magical darkness from below fades away
- There's a hole in the ground under the automaton, the rubble fell down against the wall 
- Sarah: "hey look the teardrop is glowing"
- Bloo and Nim jump down
- Sarah heals Nim's hearing problems
- Sarah stands in crevice with the bow, the bow glows
- Nim stands with arrow, it glows
- Bloo stands in net, it glows
- The teardrop is still glowing, hear a click in the distance, above and forward
- Sarah flies up, behind what was the elf mural something opens up
- Sarah opens it, see an empty room but a golden locket on the ground
- Sarah picks it up, inside it is a picture of two people, two people
	- One sarah recognizes, one vaguely recognizes
	- One half-drow women and her mother
	- And other side says: "My lovely Allie, I will never forget you"
- Sarah leaves it there 
- Also sense a strong magical presence from the locket
- Sarah: "guess i'll take it"
- Sarah is hit with a long stream of memories, see a montage of happy moments, see sarah herself in it, also see the wolf, also see a women, presume it's Violet, hear words "It's not your fault", feel guilt
- And then sarah is holding the locket
- Look up, see a desk with a bow on it, it's an ordinary bow, see a few instruments, see loot, and a small triangle
	- Looks as if it's a memorial, it's much newer than everything else
- Sarah keeps the locket, leaves everything there, closes the door, it mends itself back up
- The light of the bow, arrow, net fade, both downstairs and upstairs
- The only one glowing one is the teardrop one
- Bloo stands in the crevice with the teardrop, the wall suddenly goes up separating bloo from everyone else, and then bloo falls
- Hear another click upstairs
- The blue light turns golden, letting people go up
- Behind what was the dwarf panel, the wall it's on sinks, tall and narrow hallway, only 1 person can fit
- At the end of the hallway, see panels of glass, see inscribed square inside another tilted square, see a piece of glass, suspended and floated, it's a mirror shard
- There's also a little chest in the corner, and a suit of armor in the corner, wearing a bracelet
- Sarah investigates the bracelet, sense strong magic from it
- As Nim touches the armor stand, it collapses, the bracer with the gauntlet is still standing, the armor seems extremely rubbery
	- It's a suit of plate armor
	- It feels light
	- The bracelet is on the left hand
- Nim takes the left hand off the bracelet, the armor becomes rigid again
- Nim puts the bracelet on, and it's very tight
- Nim: "someone punch me"
- Sarah immediately punches Nim, the body feels like rubber, now you can't feel your bones
- The punch threw her back, and then rubbers
- The bracelet inverts nat 1 and nat 20, so nat 1 hits, and nat 20 fails, and things hit if below AC 
- The bracelet looks rusty, and is also very tight on Nim
- Sarah grabs Nim's arm to see how far it stretches, Sarah keeps pulling, it feels like you could pull more but it would hurt Nim
- Nim: "Maybe we should stop"
- Sarah lets go, the arm zips back in like a tape measure
- Nim coils her legs up and springs up
- Also see that the bracelet has a light around it and it's starting to burn out
- There's also a chest and layers of what looks like glass
- Yul opens the chest, it's a tunnel straight down
- Nim: "Yul, did you want to lick the shard?"
- Yul: "YES"
- Sarah: "Don't lick the shard!!"
- Yul walks towards the shard and isn't stopped by the glass
- Sarah dashes towards her and attempts to stop her, grabs Yul before she's all the way through the glass
- Sarah: "It'll make you hurty wurty"
- Yul's core is glowing white, the shard is glowing white
- Sarah: whatever
- The shard is floating
- Yul goes into the center part
- Yul starts floating up towards the shard
- On the way up Yul licks the shard
	- It tastes like death, it tastes terrible
	- Sarah: "Does that taste good?"
	- Yul: "No"
	- Sarah: "Do you regret it?"
	- Yul: "No"
- The walls shatter, the shard lodges itself in Yul's chest and lodges deeper
- Yul is glowing exceptionally bright, see spurts of blood fly out from Yul
- Yul is getting drawn into the shard
- The walls are covered in blood
- Y'all are in a room covered in crystallized blood
- Sarah: "Yul that was gross"
- Yul twerks and a spear of blood pierces down straight next to Yul
- Lyra and Nim decides to straight up jump into the chest and take the slide/tunnel down
- Nim turns into a parachute and grabs Lyra and glides down
- Bloo sees some caves, dripping caves, glowing very blue, massive underground lake
- Bloo wanders around, shimmery water
- There are glowing blue capped mushrooms
- Bloo picks up a mushroom, it glows very brilliantly blue
- Bloo eats a mushroom, and bloo's breath feels very cold
- Bloo blows at the lake, the water freezes over
- Bloo blows and walks across the lake
- See some stone pillars with some water suspended in the shape of a teardrop
- As Bloo is about to touch the teardrop, Lyra and Nim parachute down onto the ice
- Sarah can't smear blood, it's red crystalline, it doesn't look like blood, it looks crystal
- Yul is just standing there
	- Sarah: "Yul you alive?"
- Yul wakes up
	- Sarah: "Wtf u thinking"
	- Yul: \*thumbs up*
- Yul can up keep the sphere of crystallized blood, dispel it, or give in
- Bloo touches the drop, it crystallizes, I'm holding [[Aqua's Teardrop]], feel a weird presence, the ice starts shattering, the lake starts swirling down and it looks like it's swirling into a portal ^023a86
- Bloo picks 20 cold mushrooms
- Yul gives in
	- Her right hand waves up, hear a demonic voice, sounds very familiar, "Alright, it's time, Hades will return and there's nothing you can do about it"
	- Her hand raises, a bunch of spikes of blood attack Sarah
	- Sarah hits with spell cleaver and smites Yul, knocking her out instantly
	- The crystalline blood reliquifies and fades away, rains a bit of blood
	- Yul stands there like puppet, the shard is exposed
- Sarah hits the exposed shard with spell cleaver, it unwedges, and it snaps back to floating where it was, and the cage reforms
- Sarah throws Yul down after healing Yul at 1hp, Yul falls down and into the portal
- Sarah falls down and misty steps towards Bloo
- We talk
- We all step through the portal
- And there's Fae petting Sarah's horse
- Yul is just on the floor
- Sarah: "I know you're not capable of learning but I hope you learn a bit"
- Nim asks about the rubber bracelet
	- Fae: "Ah Violet has been using this as a storage room"
	- Violet is alive, she's old
	- Sarah: "Where is Violet?"
	- Fae: "idk, probably in Geimshall Woods"
	- Apparently Violet visited Bloo but Bloo doesn't remember
- Bloo asks about teardrop
	- Fae: "You'll be pivotal, you have about an hour before we march"
	- "Where are we marching?"
	- Fae: "While you were gone, it's been a couple of hours, Horace was trying to dissuade Astrid from leaving, but she said she could handle it, and she went alone"
	- Sarah: "Fucking idiot, you know it's bad when you're the only responsible one"
	- Fae: "She said she was going to stop the ritual with her chronostasis"
	- Fae: "Horace has gone off somewhere, he should be back in an hour and a half"
	- Sarah: "We gotta go immediately, we can't teleport that many people"
	- Fae: "The teardrop is the best kept secret in this castle, focus your magic"
	- Fae: "Follow me, we're going into the control room of the castle"
	- Fae: "Please slot the gem in right here"
	- Bloo feels a large quake
- The castle begins to float
	- Fae: "the reason we were taking everything out is because the castle is going to be a warship"
- Out the window, we're floating
- You have about 90 minutes, we have plenty of healers, we have about 90 minutes before we enter airspace, we've already informed horace 
- Fae: "You can have the gem back once we get to where we need to be"
- Sarah used to be a bard, something happened related to an evil entity, now she's a paladin

- That's why Sarah dropped out of college
- She was killed by some creature sent by N, some sort of aberration, showed up, killed her
- :(
- We make it to our destination
- Fae: "We've arrived, I've brought the teardrop"
- Fae: "Astrid imbued some of her magic into it, you can use it to stop its frame of time, and the fun part is it retains momentum despite being frozen in time"
	- Use it as action, bonus action, or reaction
	- The object can be used once a day (once per long rest when attuned), freeze any obj less than 25 pounds within 20 feet, and then act on it in a way that would give it momentum
- Horace shows up
- The blacksmith gives Nim her Basilisk Dagger
- Horace brought some additional firepower, idk why Astrid ran off
- Horace: "We're going to the top"
- See a woman at the top, standing tall, her handband in the wind, it's Tethys, the carriage lady
- We cannot just drop a castle on them, they're unreachable
- Astrid has put them into a time loop, she's stalling 
- On each tower, there's a platform you can control, we are going to fly them over and surround it, we're going to, Horace apparently has a plan
- Horace: "We're gonna blast the shit out of them"
- Have to deal with the surrounding raiders, supposedly Astrid will have a signal to let everyone know when she's going to drop the time loop
- The lake is surrounded
- Do not leave any operator from the League alive, kill them all
- "It's only fun if it's a war crime" -Sarah
- Bloo concentrates really hard and moves the discs lopsidedly to form a circle around the lake
- Ordered to defend the castle and not descend on Astrid's location until a signal is given
- We are all on one of the platforms, it has a watch tower in the corner, a ballista
- As we are creeping into a position
- As Sarah and Nim peek down, hear a familiar woman's voice, "I finally found you" it's [[Petra von Alspar]]!!
- Petra flies in on a black dragon, Petra flies up
	- Petra: "I don't give a shit about Jeice"
- Petra: "It's time, I'm officially part of the Order"
	- See her eyes have two lines, one streaking below, one streaking up
- She points her dagger and jumps onto the platform, holding the orb
- Petra throws a rift orb down, summons four red slaads, the dragon flies up

- See Horace is struggling
- Feel a shockwave, the platform we are on is getting pulled down, two demonic shadowy hands grab it on both sides, pulling it down
- Bloo tries to fight it, we are at a standstill
- Over the edge, near the ritual, there's a weird swirl of colors around a circle, it's about where Horace said the ritual was going to be, see a very demonic eye looking at us 
	- Nim: "That might be Hades"
- The platform is getting pulled down, the two demonic hands pull down
- Sarah silvery barbs on Nim kicking the ground to give Bloo advantage
