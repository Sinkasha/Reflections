- A foot soldier walks to Yul "can we have that please" holding a bucket

- Big, lots and lots of people, big tables
- One amused guy holding a chalice, looks over at us, "congrats you guys are the stars of tonight after all look what you have done we're all very happy and grateful so please take these seats"
  - He gestures to center table
  - Please take those seats, Astrid will join you once she recovers
- Sarah attempts to sit in the queen's chair, the man stands up and goes "ma'am your seat is over there unless you're here to approach me and chat"
- Sarah attempts to BS that she is the queen's daughter
- The color of his eyes change, they're darker brown and now lighter hazel, looks over at us and says "you are quite entertaining"
- Sarah attempts to cast Zone of Truth on him, but it kind of fades away, it does not work
  - Sarah: "Are you a liar"
  - "No I just don't think I need to answer to your inquiries"
  - "What's your name"
  - "Ezra, but Duke Navil"
    - He's the prime minister lmao
  - "Sarah you're quite entertaining, how about this, the queen isn't here"
- He snaps his finger, and Sarah is sitting in the chair right next to him, the queen's chair
- "That's a lot of fun, don't worry the queen won't be offended"

- Hear some clinking of the glass, the entire row of chairs at the front is filled but the queen
- The queen enters wearing a flowing teal dress, kind of poofy, as if she went to change, she walks out, hear her heels, she takes a spoon and glass \*tink tink tink\*
  - Hello everyone, brave warriors and soldiers, all of you today congratulations on surviving, we had many perish due to the wicked calamity, and to honor all their lives, please, a quick toast, in celebration of those who perished fighting the resurrection of a god
  - We are fortunate to have many brave warriors, particularly the group of people sent to save Astrid, please you five, please rise

  - Thank you without a doubt that given the magical prowess that it was the magical education
  - Talks about how amazing magical schools in Fusilla are
- Someone goes up, tall woman, red hair, slightly muscular, it's cheryl dvalir, as the royal ambassador, i would like to present with one last gift, present formal passports with additional perks, you are very much welcome, to ease your transportation costs, I would like to present some passports with great political power in Hyritia, this should make transportation cheaper, especially to Fusilla, your fares for domestic sea travel is completely free
- Going to Hyritia will be significantly cheaper
- One chair missing, the queen is looking around like "is she coming"
- See in the corner, two woman walk in, one is Astrid, one is Iris Galfraun, plops Astrid at our table, asks for a round of applause for Astrid

- As we finish dinner, we land in parli, safe and sound

### More Rewards!!

- We go to Iris's office
- With the promise of magical stuff, my present to you is information, because if anyone can find it it's you guys
- I heard there were some ruins found, some of the gods, I noticed on the way here, I felt the presence of a couple of fans, I believe those were treasurers, you might also know that Seliph himself, he went and found the sun god's blade, but it's very hard to find these days because of how much civilizations have kept these secrets, as one of the member of [[Characters/NPCs/The Council of Archmages]], so keep this on the down low, I heard there were some ruins for various gods some are on paths to cities but others are deep in mountains, but if you stay within this province, you can find some fun treasurers in a few areas, I'll mark it on this map, so it may not be completely accurate, but we found residuals of magic across these lands
- I know that Hugo was in [[Faltera/Fusilla/The Kingdom of Fusilla#Everholden\|Everholden]] when he encountered Theodore
- ![[Images/Iris Marked Map.png|500]]
- She was researching with the council of archmages, for reasons we do not fully know, they are also very interested because they want to collect or know locations of ancient magical artifacts
- These are the ones Iris has clearance to know
- I do know that it is quite common to, in the areas of [[Faltera/Fusilla/The Kingdom of Fusilla#Ridgepeak\|Ridgepeak]], probably because of influence from Hyritia and strong beliefs about economics, near Ridgepeak and Havenridge, there may be worship of the god of fortune, if I was to be more speculative, given the nature of Order and the more rigid nature of Ice, it's possible that [[Religion/Religion of Faltera#God of Order Lucht\|Lucht]]'s shrine is in Frostwind (God of Order)
- It's hard to get out without teleportation
- Sarah used to live somewhere around Frostwind, Sarah is from Celestial Peak, it's very cheap, but the quality of life is pretty low
- The cold is bearable it's harsh, the people there are very accustomed
- There's no guarantee these shrines will contain things similar to the fans or blade
- But I can say with certainty they won't have mirror shards
- Astrid whispers in Yul's ear
- Yul: uh oh
- Yul gets a pat on the back from Iris as Astrid takes her away
- We follow
- We walk to Astrid's office, she's writing furiously with a half-drunken mana potion
- Astrid
  - I kindly ask that the four of you that are not Yul please step out for a moment
  - This'll be fast
  - She closes the door
- Astrid approaches Yul, is slightly taller, she puts her hand out towards your chest, and Yul starts to glow, it's the shard
  - And as she glows, you see another shard, the one that you took from theodore, she takes it out of its casing and she just says "I promise- no you cannot lick it, yul stand still"
  - Astrid puts on some goggles, "I'm sorry this isn't my specialty but things should go well"
  - She takes the shard, careful not to touch it, she puts on a glove-like thing, it's like a leather glove that glows a weird color
  - She grabs the shard and she says "hold still, this is only gonna hurt a lil, weellll, maybe"
  - She punches you in the chest while holding the shard
  - Yul doesn't feel like it's tearing through your flesh, but it goes through her and there are now two shards inside of Yul, the two shards snap and fuse together into one
  - As she takes out her hand and glove, there's no blood, Yul falls down onto her knees, and Astrid opens the door
  - "The shards need to be handled carefully, I had an inkling "
  - Her powers are linked to the shards, but she has an interesting property, her body is able to suppress the effects of the shards when they're inside of the core inside of her chest
  - However from the report that Sarah had an interesting encounter when she licked it,
  - Astrid: "she should not be allowed to make physical contact with it but if it's in her core it's okay"
- Astrid attempts to punch Nim, who dodges it
- Astrid punches Sarah, everything wearing the glove phases through Sarah
- This glove is something I specially requested for a few reasons, it's quite nice, it's nice to be able to reach through someone to cast a spell
- The glove only phases through living creatures, if it has soul
- Yul has an artificial soul
- We might've defeated the order for now, but [[Characters/NPCs/Grimnir]] is still alive, not to mention how there have been portals popping up everywhere, unfortunately I think more extraplanars have been entering
- People have been disappearing but weird creatures have been appearing
- There have been some more aberrations spawning
- Haven't seen beholders or mindflayers yet, we haven't seen anything too bad, saw some slaads
- Seliph was here a mo ago, he's headed back to Vasara, he offered to me to come with, but I had to decline for the time being
- May need to go to Hyritia, guilds summoning their strongest member
- Have we heard of "Cloakers"
- There have been outbreaks, Seliph hasn't left for Vasara yet, said something about needing to get revenge on something
- Asks Astrid about the teleport glyph that was found in Violet's vault
- Astrid: Sorean I know you aren't the same fighter and your memories aren't as good, I still have your sword, I know we just left there, if you want it, I think you should have it, you're gonna need this, hands me a small silver key, that should unlock the case it's in
- I'm not sure when they'll let you in the castle, it will always be there
- Sarah do you happen to know of any creatures that can, y'know how beholders have a weird ability where their gaze is antimagic happens, have you heard of a creature that can do that that doesn't necessarily have eyes
  - Creatures with innate antimagic ability?
  - Astrid: I know a bit about your oath
  - Seliph asked me about a creature I've never heard of before, but it's been terrorizing [[Faltera/Hyritia/The Hyritian Alliance#Celestial Peak\|Celestial Peak]], there are weird depictions of it, it looks like a thin bony chimera almost
  - Rumors of creature that screams magic roar, nullifies magic where it screams
  - I'm sure Seliph knows more but he didn't run into it, he's careful to avoid it
  - Seliph wants to slay it but doesn't want to do it alone
  - Seliph wants to take it on with Sarah as a test of revenge of some sort
  - We should talk to Seliph, be quick, he might leave in the morning
  - He's staying at the same hotel Hugo is staying at
  - Astrid: I want to give some help, gives a gold pocket watch, plz don't sell it, when the time comes you might need this, I bestowed some of my magic into this
  - It channels some of my time manipulation abilities, I tried to make it powerful, I broke a few, not the best at creating magic items
  - If nothing else it appears to be able to tell time pretty accurately
  - It's better than our wall clocks lol, doesn't need to be recalibrated or retuned
  - I do have a little bit of surprise in there if the need arises
  - You can always come visit
  - Aberration not a beholder, didn't look like it had a face
  - Idk it's affiliation

### Seliph, Hotel de Aqua

- We go look for Seliph, we go towards the Hotel de Aqua, run into Hugo
  - Glad to see you survived
  - Seliph is in the room two floors above, I'm in a rush, guess what they didn't cancel classes
  - I have to grade papers, but Nim, there's some things I want to discuss about new discoveries in the archaeological world, I was peer reviewing a paper and wanted to run it by you
  - Nim: can't take undergrad children with me, too stupid to protect
  - Hugo scurries off
- We try to open Seliph's door
- Seliph: AH NOT THE FANBOYS
- Sarah asks Seliph about the aberration with the antimagic scream
  - Sara remember that convo we had about the thing that killed Allie, I think it's the same thing
  - They're calling it a woestrider
  - It's apparently galloping away, zapping away magic
  - I was gonna head to Vasara cause some ports will take us there, I figured I'd let you know
  - Sarah: "Let's go kill that shit"
  - I did hear a ferocious roar as I made it into the temple, I'm glad it has divine protection
  - Artifacts are immune to antimagic
  - Asks if [[Religion/Religion of Faltera#God of the Sun Clarus\|Clarus]]'s sword is an artifact
  - Sarah attempts to trade a sword from Theodore for Clarus's sword, will talk about it in Vasara
  - Try talking to artificer to figure out how Theodore's sword works
  - I'll happily give it to you and teach you how it works
