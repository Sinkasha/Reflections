# Chat is this real?
## Session 20

##### Important Things

### 04.18.0347 Night | Everholden Ruins, [[Faltera/Fusilla/The Kingdom of Fusilla#Everholden\|Everholden, Fusilla]]
- See massive massive pit that goes down very far
- All that you are told is it's the entrance
- Nim tosses a pebble down the entrance
- Nim and Bloo scratch some math in the cave, tie their 50 ft. ropes together, and throw it down the pit
	- 2.36 seconds fall, about 27 meters, about 90 feet
- We all jump in, Nim casts Feather Fall, we land in a cavern
- Bloo casts Light
- Cold and dry air, feels empty, see stalactites on the ceiling, walls eroded, doesn't look like anyone has been down here in a long time
- We move through a narrow chokepoint in the cave
- Enter into a new part of the cave (kinda like Tennessee-shaped), see a sleek marble wall ish at the opposite end of the cave, very smooth
- There are 10 pillars in front of this marble wall
- Each pillar has a metal plaque in it that has a message written in Dwarvish ^b4bb68
	- The metal is hanging like a painting
	- 1: As it is divinely ordained all shall be mine
	- 2: The true beauty of life lies in its structure
	- 3: Others shall be crushed beneath my heel
	- 4: *scratched out* 
	- 5: Only in truth shall we find true justice
	- 6: It is writ therefore it is thus
	- 7: Unpredictability is the highest virtue
	- 8: Mind, body, and soul as one
	- 9: May the golden wind bless us all
	- 10: *scratched out*
- Passing between 5th and 6th one, there's a bust, a head of a particular being that Nim recognizes, it is [[Religion of Faltera#God of Consciousness Azathoth\|Azathoth]], and his mouth is open
	- One of the progenitor gods, primitive god of consciousness, what gave creatures consciousness and intelligence
	- At some point he split himself into multiple gods, now known as the gods of human nature, the only four that are common knowledge are chaos, order, fortune, and greed, but it's believed among academics who research this he has more parts than four
	- Azathoth probs split himself up into 10, four are gods we know, and Nim knows two others, benevolence and malice
- Nim inspects the bust, the opening in its mouth is a little small, but it looks like it can fit a human hand
- Nim turns to Yul and asks for Jeice's hand
- Yul gives Nim the hand, Nim places the hand in Azathoth's mouth, it slowly closes, the jaw looks like it's trying to close more but it's jammed
- Nim takes the hand out, there are some stone teeth marks on the hand
- Bloo moves the placard 1, a smooth gemstone, it's clear and transparent
- Identical one behind placard 2, also behind 4 and 10
- We swap placard's 9 and 10
- Nim tries placard 10 on every pillar, nothing happens
- Bloo takes the gemstone in pillar 1 and puts it in Azathoth his eyes glow white and then the jaw reopens
- In pillar 2: glows white
- Reset the placards 
- Above the bust, it says "only those who show their true hand are allowed entry"
- Sarah walks up and puts her hand in Azathoth's mouth, nothing happens
- Lyra fans out her playing cards, the top card she pulls is the five of hearts, and under that is the five of diamonds
- Bloo takes the fifth gemstone out, there's a brief flash of green, also see one from the 8th one
- Nim gets the 8th one out, it flashes green
- Bloo puts the fifth gemstone, the eyes glow green, the jaw reopens, an entire part of the wall in the middle sinks into the ground, revealing a new passageway
	- Takes it out, wall goes back up
- Puts the 8th one in, glows yellow, and another small narrow hallway opens up to the right of the main hallway
- These two are the only gemstones that do anything
- We do the 8th gemstone small hallway
### 8th Gemstone Small Hallway, Everholden Ruins
- Staircase, opens up into a room
- Sarah - Bloo - Nim - Yul - Lyra
- Walk down 1.5 flights of stairs
- See lots of cobwebs, underneath a certain mound of cobweb there's a chest
- Bloo uses mage hand to dust off cobwebs off the chest
- Hear loud noise from above in the ceiling
- Nim walks in a bit and looks at the ceiling, sees three giant spiders descend down
- They look a little miffed at having their cobweb disturbed
- One big spider walks up slowly and hisses at us
- Bloo holds up a ice mushroom to the spider
- The middle spider snatches the mushroom, Bloo offers one to each which they all nom on, then they come back for more
- Lyra gave them a marshmallow
- Bloo keeps feeding them mushrooms to distract them
- Nim sneaks to the chest, opens it, sees a giant scroll, also dusted in cobwebs, scroll with weird script, written in multiple diff. languages, appears to be a translation scroll, translates Primordial into Common
- Nim takes the scroll, closes the chest, and sneaks all the way back
- The spiders chill on the ceiling
- We walk out
### 5th Gemstone Big Hallway, Everholden Ruins
- Hallway opens into large marble palace like interior
- It would've been quite adorned, two busts on left and right after hallway opens out
- Two busts, no mouths, looks feminine
- Big statue in the back, spiral staircase that goes up on left and right
	- A tall slender women, her mouth is covered with right hand and other hand pointing out, looking towards where finger is pointing (looks Romanesque), wearing a circlet 
	- Nim does not recognize her
	- The busts are of the same person
	- Placard at bottom of statue, written in Primordial, "to our goddess [[Religion of Faltera#Goddess of Honesty Veritus\|Veritus]] only you know the truth"
	- Inscription: "Goddess of honesty"
- Spiral staircase on our left goes down, on our right goes up
- The statues are slightly newer than statues seen depicting Azathoth, newer than Azathoth bust outside, it also dates to period where you speculated the current gods of human nature started emerging
### Up Spiral Staircase, Veritus Foyer
- A small room with a pedestal / podium, on it is an inscription in Primordial "place an item of personal significance and your honesty will be awarded"
- Sarah places her locket on it, she feels as if her soul is being judged, feel otherworldly (beyond your recognition) similar to powers channeled during divine smite, a spark of light flows out, rams into the wall, and glows up steps that are very high up
- Only Sarah can see it, so it looks like Sarah is walking through a wall
- Nim pokes the wall and feels nothing, no wall
- Underneath the steps it looks like a long way down
- Sarah is going across, on the other side, inside, sees three chests and two more busts of Veritus
- Bloo ties themself to Yul and goes across
- Sarah opens the left chest, and it snaps off, a dead mimic, there is a dried out tong and teeth from the mimic in the chest
- The middle one is sealed, very thick lock but also appears to have a weird glow
- Sarah tries to break it open, feels a sort of presence on your soul, disapproving feel
- Sarah opens chest on right, inside it Sarah sees a pile of 32 gp, a spell scroll of witch bolt, and a wand of conducting, and a rock
- Something that showed up after the crow mask is an inscription on the wall, "only a scant few know that honesty's true hue is a deep sea blue"
- Nim places her hand on the pedestal, Nim feels the judgement, feels as if someone is looking at your soul, hear whispers and voices saying "so this is how you see yourself" 
	- Looks over at your chest and sees a golden glow from Nim's heart
- Nim joins Sarah and Bloo
- Nim pokes the lock and says "Open" on the middle chest, feel an even greater sense of judgement
- Bloo unties the rope and Yul gets all the rope back
- Yul un-redifies her fan and puts it on the pedestal, Yul can now see the path as well
- Lyra places a marshmallow, it's very faint but Lyra can see the path
- Sarah's was very bright, the amount of brightness is dictated by the importance of the object
- Bloo looks over the edge, see faint traces of green purple blue red yellow and black, like faint beams upwards
- Bloo puts their hand on the pedestal, doesn't glow, nothing happens
- Sarah and Bloo holds rope, Nim lowers her down into the void
- Nim can't see the light, only see darkness, there is nothing at 15 feet down
- Bloo throws down a pebble that has Light cast on it, vaguely see a general shape of the room below
- Nim is a little under halfway down
- We keep lowering Nim, sees before you the room you're in, there appears to be six giant crystals, purple, red, yellow, green, blue, black
- Also see along the wall there is an indentation, there is a fountain on the other side of the wall
- There's a thick mirror, and on the other side, there are also crystals, black blue yellow purple red 
- ![[../Pasted image 20240807205730.png|300]]
- Other then color mismatch and no stairs, rooms are a match
- Pedestal in the center beside mirror
- The indentation to the staircase, which goes back up to the foyer with the two staircases
### Down Spiral Staircase
- bowl in golden pedestal beside mirror
- The crystals are taller than us and are protruding from the ground and was shooting up the light
- Only water in fountain
- In the bowl (fixed) is a chalice (unfixed)
- Nim fills the chalice with water from the fountain
- Even tho you can see your perfect reflection, no water being poured in mirror
- Nim splashes water at the purple crystal, it's clear going in, goes black as it goes out, also black out the other side of the mirror
- Throws into the green crystal, blue coming out
- Nim walks through the green crystal, the water in the chalice turns blue
- Nim pours blue water into bowl, the water drains through the bottom, almost like absorbed
- Nim walks through all the crystals and it just changes the color of the water 
- Nim takes clear water in the chalice, both reflection and real Nm run into the wall
- Put chalice of blue water on statue upstairs on Veritus's hand and nothing happens
- Pour black water into bowl, notice that your reflection isn't pouring any water at all, nothing happens
- The water in the reflection has only shown up when the water is blue
- Nim dumps blue water into the fountain, not a lot of things on this side change, but the fountain water in the reflection is now blue
- Nim scoops up clear water from her side of the fountain, reflection side gets blue water, the chalice empties into the bowl, from Nim's perspective you just look up, and now no one is near you, you turn around and they are no longer there, Nim is in the mirrored side
- The others can see the reflection but Nim can't
- Nim took the chalice
- Nim walks through the blue crystal, gets blue water (on the reflected side) pours it into the bowl, and comes back to the real side
- Her reflection has now disappeared
- Nim has both chalices, puts one down, pours the blue one down, is now on the other side
- Bloo pours blue water into the thing, joins Nim on mirror side
- For many many attempts, pouring nothing
- On the other side, three people can't see the other two
- Nim holding mirror side chalice on the mirror side, pours blue water into the bowl
- Nim's reflection is back
- Bloo is holding an empty chalice, the fountain water is clear on both sides, Bloo appears to be alone in the room, Bloo notices that the water on their side is flowing much faster
- Dark spot in the mirror where I should be
- The mirror side chalice is colorless, and the reflection 
- Bloo dunks the head in the fountain, some water gets in eyes, now that the water is over my eyes, see your reflection, I can see everyone, they cannot see you, but there's a weird illusion thing on the left wall like heat rays that's fading away
- There's an indentation, Bloo presses it, it clicks, and the mirror is receding forwards on both sides, the mirror is now very thin
- Can now see bloo
- Bloo holding blue water chalice, walks through the mirror
- Now Bloo and Nim don't have reflections again
- In the same exact spot where Bloo pressed the button, there's another button on the real side
- Nim presses it, Nim and Bloo pop out of existence, on the other side, the other three lose their reflection, the mirror looks more like glass now, can see each other directly through the glass now
- The wall retreats back, and now there are two hallways, one on each side 
- We exchange chalices, both sides now have one chalice filled with blue water
- Left hallway has Sarah Yul Lyra
- Right hallway has Bloo and Nim
- Left side: arrows shooting extremely fast in both directions, past that, occasionally a cone of fire sprays out
- Right side: A large set of spikes that periodically shoot up thru the ground, occasionally two cone of fires shooting at each other 
	- Pretty far down the hallway, it ends, see a door
	- A switch to our left, before the spikes, it doesn't look real
	- Bloo presses the switch, the spikes move faster and now more spikes
	- Hear footsteps from above, look up, on the ceiling you see a shadow, Bloo and Nim run back
- Left side: lever in the arrows and button where the fire is shooting
	- Yul, looking through glass with blue water, like using a lens, the arrows disappear, don't see the lever or button, see empty hallway
	- The arrows phase through, don't feel anything at all, the arrows are fake
- Sarah walks through after telling her about the shadow
- We walk down the right hallway, the three of us look up, hear scuttling, see 
- Sarah uses Divine Sense, doesn't feel or smell anything, do hear more scuttling, flying spider
- 3 Flying spiders land in front of us
- Toss mushroom onto the ground, it noms the 
- Sarah goes to left hallway, sprints through to the end, end of the hallway has nothing, it feels like wood, Sarah tries to break it down, the door on the right hallway got kicked open
- Bloo misty steps twice down the hallway
- The two hallways connect together and then combine into one hallway
- We reconvene
### End of two hallways
- Another door at end of hallway, locked
- Sarah smashes the door open, it was pretty old
- See a room, a very small room, there's a slightly raised platform, on it, there's a sigil that none of you have seen before
	- ![[../Images/Goddess of Honesty Temp.png|300]]
	- Primordial and Dwarvish written on wall: "speak not a lie and you may advance"
	- Sarah stands on pedestal and says "I am not green"
	- Sarah is warped away
	- Nim stands on pedestal and says: "I am not a banana"
	- The three rest of the ppl stand on it, Bloo says "I am not a tiger"
	- Only Bloo warped
	- Yul: "I am not Nim"
	- Lyra: "I am not a cat"
- All get warped
- We flow through various streams, flowing through immaterial, zoom over, exit on the other side, all seem like you know a few things
- It's like we've all shared a common experiences, memories of your lives have been flooded into each other's brains
	- See a young Seliph getting dunked on for milk through his nose and being called names, see a sincere Sarah coming to his aid 
	- Visions of a young Allie and a pet wolf 
	- See Nim cramming for an exam and nervously presenting her dissertation and a feeling of adrenaline as you are conferred your degree
	- Lyra is sitting there feeling ostracized from her human family, clinging onto what little she had of her father before meeting Horace, but a bit of familial bonding and warmth to playing poker with an unconscious father
	- See visions of fighting, visions of Astrid, and [[Characters/NPCs/Violet]], and your life as a blob
	- See flooding visions of being constructed almost as though you're looking at yourself but someone who's more gentle and taller and one who does not eat sand, she gives a lot of care, hear the words "you are my greatest accomplishment in life" as the hand slowly falls away never to see that face again :(
	- Meanwhile, see visions in the [[Faltera/Fusilla/The Kingdom of Fusilla#Geimshall Woods\|forest]], some sort of blob making its way through, but inside there's a weird temple yet you feel so compelled to go towards it, and as you're making your way towards the temple, see a familiar face, see Violet entering a sanctuary that feels super familiar but never seen again, as you inch your blob-y way over, all five of you are spat out on the other end
	- The only thing in this room, at the end, is a massive door, chiseled into it is another instance of this sigil of Veritus, it's clean cut in half, appears you are missing something
- There's a massive key hole in the door 
- Sarah's rock is glowing, she puts her rock in the key hole, the rock as you see through the blue water is a key
- Turn the key, the doors open wide, inside you are met with a massive sanctum
- See many many many cobwebs covering a few statues, see two identical statues of Veritus, identical and much larger, and you see a massive stone throne 
- Ton of cobwebs on the statues, a gold coin mound in the center 
- We all go towards the gold
- Nim look up and see a gigantic hulking shadow, but this time, the head looks reptilian, if even draconic
- Nim sees spider legs descending down, hear a roar that pierces the room, see more webs shooting down
- Webs shoot down, the only thing you can see is this massive hulking spider dragon
- He's massive, descends down near all of us, and he starts speaking
- He's speaking in Draconic
- Switching languages, but cannot understand
- Bloo uses comprehend languages scroll
	- "What are you doing in my trove? What is your purpose"
- Left statue has circlet, right statue has a mask, it's flat, covers entire face, one single where eye socket would be, but both carved into statue
- Nim speaks Dwarvish, he vaguely understands
	- "We're looking for a crown"
	- "Crown? That's mine"
	- Gold also mine, tell me then, why are you here
	- Coughs up bones and spits them out (whoever was here last), hundreds of years ago
	- Appears to have served orig. purpose of offering room, throne is where offering platform is
	- Veritus's throne
	- Dragon doesn't care about Veritus, doesn't care about gods of the planes
		- That little god has been dead for many many years
	- Sarah attempts to convince him to let him go outside, he's not amused
- Sarah attempts walks out, the dragon scurries over to look at Sarah
	- "You didn't take anything did you"
- The dragon spins a web over the entrance
- Sarah cuts it down, the dragon scurries back to the gold hoard
### Up Spiral Staircase again
- we go back to the up spiral staircase with the floating stuff area
- We place a chalice of blue water on the pedestal, which vanishes
- Sarah and Bloo and Nim head to the chest area
- We pour blue water on the chest, nothing happening
- Sarah smites the chest
- Bludgeon the chest, unaffected by radiant damage, absorbed by chest
- Sarah keeps hitting the chest, eventually you bust open the chest, but it's empty
- Upon smashing the chest, Sarah hears a light voice that just exudes disappointment
	- "That is not how you will find what you seek"
	- And now the chest is shattered on the ground
	- And we mend it back together with Mending
- On the back of the chest is an inscription that says "The key is somewhere within the heart"
- Bloo touches the lock, thinking of something they really want, feels something flashing before you
	- Fixated on idea of wanting memories back, see vision of throne, of Bloo sitting on it, and all of a sudden see something else in that room, see the circlet on one of the statue's and the mask start to glow, you have a feeling those are not in stone
	- The chest does not open, the chest changes shape and is now a pillar
	- Only Bloo sees this change
	- This pillar looks as tho it is a statue of Sorean
		- But it also appears to be morphing, as Bloo gets closer it gets blob like
	- Bloo touches the statue, feel a sense of familiarity, feel as though there's a reason why you emerged from the Geimshall Woods, you weren't going towards Violet, was *leaving* Violet as though you were exiting the sanctum, feel a weird sense of nostalgia as tho you want to go back to visit
	- Get a sense that she knows who you are, she knew your identity, and concealed it from Astrid for some reason
	- Retracts hand, the statue looks like a hand as it once was
- Bloo tells Sarah
	- Sarah really wants to get the artifact
	- Sees a vision of horse-like limbs, chains rattling, a gruesome scream, see a wormhole, screaming distorted faces, but inside you reach your hand, for a familiar face, one that you know is surely out there, reach into the maw of this horse-like creature as it screams and you slowly fall in and you grab a gentle hand and then the vision fades, the chest is not transformed
- Nim grabs the lock
	- Nim sees Veritus, she's alive, she's alone
	- She seems to be fighting, wearing a circlet, dons a mask, hear a voice "I know where you are, I see you, I know your true form, it's wretched" ^d269fb
	- But then she's attacked, swallowed by an abyss
	- "I know your true form" she proclaims "I know the truth behind you" "I figured it out" but she is swallowed by the darkness
	- She takes off the mask and circlet and throws them away out of the abyss and fall to the material plane
	- Two ppl fighting her, two of Nyarlathotep's generals, recognize one of them is a name that is familiar Abyss, the other you don't recognize
	- See a flash of white light, as your vision is swallowed 
	- See vision of self sitting on throne, your eyes are glowing, in there you see the inner sanctum, see the circlet on the left statue and on the right statue, the mask glows brightly, also see something buried amidst the gold
### Dragon
- In the room we spoke a not truth, a fountain has appeared
- Pouring clear water, but inscription that glows says "the blue blood of magic flows, the red essence of life flows, the restoration of purple flows" ^7bdb19
- We will slay the dragon raaahhh
