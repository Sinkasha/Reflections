### 04.18.0347 Night | Everholden Ruins, [[Faltera/Fusilla/The Kingdom of Fusilla#Everholden\|Everholden, Fusilla]] | Dragon
- The only way forward is to fight the dragon
- Bloo casts Armor of Agathys, it's darkness flavored
- "Does darkness taste like deez nuts?"
- We walk into the room and don't see the dragon
- The ceiling is 150 ft. tall
- Bloo mage hands a Light rock upwards
- Hear a voice as it slowly descends "You've decided to come back, why is that"
- He steps towards us, at least 40 feet above us
- Yul counts his legs out loud
	- Drake: You can count them as I slash you to pieces
- Bloo casts Hex, Dex disadvtg
- Nim shoots with the bow while the drake is monologuing about the bad spell and perfectly pierces his jaw
- **Dragon**: "I was hoping to have some fun with you, but I guess you don't want to"
	- He pulls the arrow out
	- He exhales a bunch of poisonous spiderlings onto all of our faces
	- See the spiderlings are crawling out of its mouth and scrawling around
	- "Was that enough to convince you to leave?"
	- Nim: "We came to sit on your throne"
- **Bloo**: Casts Tasha's Mind Whip
	- He fails saving throw
	- Dragon flinches, some spiders fall out of his jaw, he reels back, underestimated us
- **Lyra**: Yul gives lyra a greater healing potion, Lyra is constantly shouting "SHOTS SHOTS SHOTS" and downs a shot
	- Casts Fireball on the dragon, around where the gold is, and the explosion superheats the gold, around some of the area where he's perched on, the gold melted and his foot slipped in, and burns some webs too
	- Lyra starts Fortnite dancing 
- **Yul**: Uses her fan [[Miscellaneous/Susanoo]] to Call Lightning "Wakey wakey time to get your ass clapped"
	- Spawns a storm cloud in the room and summons lightning on the dragon
	- Walks up to Lyra and administers a potion of healing
- **Nim**: Moves halfway up towards the dragon, Nim throws her basilisk dagger at the dragon
	- Moves a little closer to Bloo
- **Dragon**: He screams, a cloud of dust emerges from his mouth, and tiny little spiders crawl out of his eye sockets
	- He decides to try to bite off his own legs to try to free himself from the gold, he still has 5 legs
	- He flops to the size from lack of balance from only one right leg
	- He's saying less than kind words in draconic
- **Bloo**: Lightning bolts his head
	- As his body is getting shocked, see life drain from his eyes, see a weird black cloud leave his mouth
	- It fizzles up and makes a weird shape, sparks red in the middle of the cloud
	- Hear a voice that says "What a failure"
- Nim *sprints* up to the cloud, no hesitation, and bottles up the weird smoke
	- The body of the spider dragon crumbles and fades away into ashes
	- Nim acquires a yogurt jar filled with the flavor of death
- The dragon left behind its horns and parts of his skull
- Bloo tosses up a light towards the very tall ceiling
	- See sacks in giant cobwebs almost like a spider egg sac but weirdly crystallized
	- About 130 ft. above us
- Nim walks below to investigate them, looks inorganic
- Attached to ceiling by thick cobwebs, wrapped in silk almost
- We loot the gold
	- Yul attempts to take all three dragon legs
	- 570 gp, 114 gp each
	- It's just gold coins above a mound
	- Underneath it is a giant mound / bulge of stone, it looks like the room was uprooted
- Lyra fire bolts at the egg sacs, and completely misses
	- Now she hits again
	- It lands in front of Nim, it feels like a geode
	- Using her pickaxe, she cracks it
	- Inside it is naturally formed crystals but also see a blue looking gem
		- This one is clearer and purer than one you've ever seen, purest sapphire you've ever seen, has a very strong magical aura
	- Nim takes the sapphire
- We smash open the other two, and the other is just standard fare of crystals, nothing too interesting
- Bloo sits on the throne
	- See an interesting sight, see the two on one fight, see, once again, two weird interesting beings, one representing a black void, Abyss, and the other embodying emptyness, it's unlike a being that anyone has ever seen before, even for a god 
	- [[Religion of Faltera#Goddess of Honesty Veritus\|Veritus]] fights, she dons a mask, like looking thru her POV, she reaches out she gets swallowed by the void, but before that you see her hand taking off the mask and throwing it away
	- Another flashback, see a tall jaunty like fellow, he's sitting down rather lazily, he's rather disinterested, he looks down upon the material plane from his throne, see he's looking curiously at humans and humanity, he casts his fingers and ppl start behaving a lil differently, a time lapse of civilization, he looks entertained (this is [[Religion of Faltera#God of Consciousness Azathoth\|Azathoth]])
	- But see a vision, a dark figure coming in, it's [[Religion of Faltera#God of Death Nyarlathotep\|Nyarlathotep]], he's trying to talk with Azathoth (current POV), he looks over, there's a conversation about humanity, they chat for a lil while
	- Azathoth mentions that humanity seems intriguing, that they seem worth looking into, it could be fun, giving sentience, they seem to be enjoying that
	- Nyarlathotep is dissatisfied, it seems that he thinks he should be the only one with sentience and intelligence, he yells at Azathoth
	- "They have the power, they always have" says Azathoth
	- N swears that he will be going for Azathoth's head
	- Azathoth in front of 9 clay statues, some look familiar, others do not, recognize depictions of gods of you've heard of, and most recently, Veritus, Lucius, Hrym, Aurus, also see a few others ^fa89eb
	- Azathoth isn't as large and jaunty as he was before, he's fading away and looks determined
	- As he closes his eyes, see the perspective of 9 others, and then shwoom, Bloo is back
- Bloo notices that the statues to left and right, originally circlet and mask looked a little off, but now they look like they're made of shining polished quartz (mask) and fine rose gold (circlet)
- Bloo walks over to the masked statue, and mage hands it down, it looks kind of like the Greek playwright mask, a neutral expression, neither smile nor frown
- Bloo puts on the mask, there are no eyeholes, just see quartz
- To others, it looks like stone until Bloo puts it on, and then it looked like a solid chunk of quartz with a swirl design
	- Telling/hearing lies or truth doesn't change anything
- Bloo walks over and grabs the circlet, puts it on, it doesn't react
- Bloo wears both and sits on the throne, but this time there's another vision, staring at the interior of the throne room, but there's a dark figure in here on the other side of the mound, no other allies here
- Feel a strong a magical aura from him, and it feels sinister, it feels as tho it is fear and death itself
- Feel a heavy presence as he looks over at the throne, he raises his hand, there's a floating giant spider, and claw and scale of dragons, he moves his hands as though he's throwing parts of the dragon into the spider, blasting it with weird magic, and lets it set down, and then he teleports away
- Time is speeding up, this being is evolving, it's constantly writhing in pain, it's growing, it's spider head emerges out of its body and into a neck as it lets out a screech
- In pain from creation, it was created here, and as it lived it died here
- Bloo gets off the throne, Nim gets on it, sees the same visions
- Lyra gets on the throne, sees the same thing
- Yul sits down, and starts glowing 
	- Sees flashes of light emerging from within this mound of stone in addition to all previous visions
	- Yul takes the pickaxe from Nim, twerks over the mound
	- Her cheeks touches the stone, as she gets up her eyes start glowing, see a weird visage of a shard is present, the shard isn't actually here, it's holographic, but it looks like it *was* here
	- Yul sees past the illusion, have a weird sensation that you remember, this feels like a shard was here, and you can feel a strong feeling of necromancy magic, but it's unlike *anyone* you've ever seen
	- Feel some of the death energy of the shard was used to create the dragon
	- Yul can now sense this shard if she's in its vicinity
- 2 legs are spider, one leg is dragon
- Nim takes the horns and the skull after breaking off the horns
- Yul takes the knees of the dragon
- Nim surmises that the bulge of the stone is its egg, the dragon's egg
- Nim breaks off a piece, it's crystallized calcite
- Nim hands it to Yul, who licks it, it tastes like death and necromancy magic, tastes putrid
- We investigate the wall behind the throne, it looks like the rest of the walls
- Yul sweeps the room, cleans out all the cobwebs
- We head out to go back to the room Sarah was left in, the one we got teleported into
- When warping, the mask now has the symbol of Veritus on the mask, engraved in rose gold, but then it disappears
- The circlet doesn't react, Bloo wears the mask and goes onto the platform, the face pattern disappears and is replaced with the symbol of Veritus
	- This entire room looks incredibly well lit despite it being dim
	- On the wall previously unseen, see, in rose gold text, "Possessor of the all-seeing mask"
- Bloo douses their face in the fountain water, the color of the fountain water is blue, Bloo douses their head in it and drinks some, Bloo restores one spell slot of the highest level
- Bloo dips the mask in, take it out, now the mask looks like plain quartz like it did a little while ago, with swirls on it, nothing happens when I wear it
- Bloo dunks the circlet, and now the circlet glows, feel a strong magical aura emanating from it
- Bloo wears it, Bloo feels strangely confident, also feel as though you can feel the brain cells in your head, neuron activation, thinks "woah"
	- Say "the sky is not blue"
	- The words are able to utter your mouth, feel a sense of "that wasn't supposed to be a thing I said"
- Bloo says "the sky is blue" and "the sky is not blue"
- Bloo starts levitating, a veil of white light is shining on Bloo, floating up, looks to everyone else that Bloo gets dragged down into the pad
- Bloo is no longer in the room
- Bloo comes to in a room that looks like this: 
- ![[../Pasted image 20240822195748.png|400]]
	- The bulge is actually grates, view of a big room that looks really old, in the center there is a crown that has four slots
	- It's decor
	- It is a giant 3D sculpture of the crown
	- It looks like a statue
- On the one that's facing us, there's a blue gemstone in one of its prongs, Bloo is high up looking at it
- Bloo pulls across the bars and dent them over, they gave pretty easily
- There's a grate on the opposite wall from mine, there's a grate on each side
- Bloo stands on the platform
- On the other side, the light hasn't faded yet
- Nim walks into the light, and pops up right next to Bloo who is talking about grass being green or not green
- Nim is holding the sapphire, it glows
- Bloo stays at the top holding a rope, and Nim slides down
- See the giant statue of the crown
- It's a blue indentation in the crown, Nim puts the blue sapphire in the blue indentation
- That prong sinks into the ground
- The other colors: red, white, orange
- The other walls all have grates, but can't see into the rooms, they're too high
- The teleportation pad is glowing white again on Bloo's side
- Bloo lets go of the rope for Nim
- On the red side, Nim takes the rope and ties it to the grate
- Lyra balances a marshmallow on Sarah's head
- Lyra and Yul also go through the white light
- Yul steps back, feel like you're floating upwards, but not quite strong enough
- Yul flaps her arms, she flaps so hard that she bangs her head on the ceiling, and then just falls straight in and pops up on the other side
- Yul draws a mustache on Sarah
- Yul takes the goblets and takes some fountain water and brings some back
- Nim sees a significantly smaller room that appears to be empty
- Nim tries to pry open the bars
	- These ones seem reinforced and can't be pried open
- Nim tries the orange side, can't budge the bars
- White side, these grates are actually a gate, more of a wire mesh gate door, but it's locked from this side
- Nim picks the lock, the gate swings open
- The room is pretty empty, there's a big staircase at the back that goes up, and underneath the staircase there's a door 
- We all slide down and climb up the rope
- At the top of the stairs, see a weird stone room, also see sunlight streaming in from above
- There's a metal grate near the top
- Also see that there is a little statue of someone you don't recognize, a generic statue
- The statue is a depiction of Azathoth, and only Bloo recognizes it while wearing the mask
- The statue looks back, Bloo: "Hello", "Hello mortal", doesn't respond with anything except "hello mortal"
- Bloo puts the mask on Azathoth, now the statue itself moves around a little, now it's in the pose of Veritus, taking off the mask it fades back to normal pose
- Put both mask and circlet on, but the color of the circlet fades back into the stone
- Bloo gives the mask to Yul and tell her to say hello to the statue
- The statue says back "Hello child genesis" ^2f88e6
	- "I see you brought friends, I recognize another of you, how do you two fare"
	- "It is nice of you to bring another of your kin with you"
	- "Kin? Huh do you not recognize, she is standing right next to you" (Lyra is standing next to her)
	- "You seem confused, that is okay for now"
	- "Please, step towards me"
	- Yul steps towards the statue, the statue looks back and says "Thank you for bring my sapphire, please restore my other artifacts, I yet still miss the ruby, the jasper, and the diamond"
	- Asks about location, "I know not, unfortunately, each of these gems is an old artifact of my old friends in the Pantheon, though not of my kin, my ability to convey information is limited, but as you possess the all seeing mask it is channeled and more powerful. I thank you, Veritus's memory is long since forgotten. Do you know where you are?"
	- "You are far away from where you originally began, you are in a temple I constructed, I still wanted to be able to talk to the element, my time is not long but I am glad to see Hrym's (god of chaos) descendent" 
	- "The answers you seek are not here, I believe we are located in what you folks call Vasara, long far away from where you once were, it is a blessing that I got to meet you here, but alas I cannot but guide you anymore"
	- "Find other fragments of mine forgotten descendants, or the ones that are remembered, for I might be granted the strength that I may need your fire"
	- Yul offers the statue of Azathoth a banana
	- "This is delightful, I was certainly correct for granting consciousness to your kind, for you act with such odd displays of gratitude, I enjoy this object you call a banana"
	- The statue now smells like bananas
	- "And you" (who looks at Lyra) "descendent of my own kin" (and suddenly Lyra can hear now) "the truths that you might seek are not to be found here either, but should you learn more in return, I will be able to offer you more"
	- "That is all I can say for now"
	- "When the time is right and you bring me another source of power, that way we may talk once again"
	- And the statue reverts back to looking like just a dude
- Lyra's amulet is glowing (the one that Horus gave to her), the purple one
- Yul informs the group of what happened
- Nim knows that the crown is not Azathoth's, it's something he assisted in creating, has to do with the elemental gods (Crown of the Elements)
- The sapphire is Tethy's, primitive god of water
- Air is likely diamond, fire is ruby, jasper is earth
- We go to open the door under the stairs, as we walk out in a grassy plain 
	-  CON save for touching grass (bruh)
	- See a door, as we walk out amidst a grassy plain, we walk a circle around the door, and look at it from the front and it slowly fades away
	- See walls in the distance, see Vasara in the distance
	- We are just north of Vasara, about half a day's travel by foot
- We are way ahead of Seliph, about 3 days ahead
