##### Important Things
- Yul goes to dig through the trash, finds something with the callsign of the [[Guilds/The League of Larcenists\|LoL]] but has text that denounces the LoL, and gets kidnapped
- Learn that this is likely "The Dawn", an organization in the area that dislikes the LoL
- We start gathering herbs for the alchemist and blacksmith to try to get some use out of our loot, and then decide we should go find Yul
### 04.20.0347 Morning | Vasara
- Seliph arrives tomorrow, the 21st
- We wander
- Magic shop
- Interesting figures in the alleys
- We go to the magic store
- Gruff looking guy with a scar with a hood in the alley, sizes us up then averts gaze
	- Recall decent network of ppl in the know in this area
- Quiet whispers in the alley
- Bloo and Nim are sneakily listening, but Sarah and Yul are seen, both men are human-esque
- "Mind your own business you're staring"
- Sarah walks directly up to them and stares past them, end of alleyway is a couple garbage cans, lots of trash, surprisingly since close to guild
- See some writing, crumpled
	- Yul wants to dig thru the trash
	- Yul wants to walk past them, but they fan out and block her way
	- Yul tries to jump over them but the two men grab her feet, she lands on the other side and is tripped and now prone, now on the ground in a back alley surrounded by two thugs while Sarah is just watching
	- The two guys: you can't be wanting to look into that trash can that badly
	- Yul: yeah
	- Guys: We can't let you do that
	- Yul: Why?
	- Guys: You don't know what's been in those trash cans, you don't have to rifle through people's stuff like that, you don't know if it's poisoned or tainted
	- Nim tries to slip down the alley, the alley is narrow, and one of the guys looks at Nim and says "who tf r u"
	- Nim: "I hate Yul we were just gonna go to the blacksmith"
	- Guy: "Oh she has a name" stomps on her leg
	- Yul hellish rebukes them
	- Guy: Bro who are you 
	- Sarah: intimidates the guy into letting us look through the trash
	- They walk down the alley and take a left
- Yul goes dumpster diving, find assorted pieces of paper written in gibberish common, the phrases seem nonsensical, see some numbers and symbols, except see the callsign of the League of Larcenists, and on that note there's a bunch of weird phrases in common
	- "the walls plastered and spoke highly of thine divine wrath"
	- Nim reads, it's thieves cant, "meeting with the dawn, never be late, never cross him, never bother him in his office", a list of commandments
	- Also see renouncing league of larcenists, we don't need to do what the league does
	- Negative attitude towards the league, says they're rather stupid 
	- This organization, with no logo or name, seems to act like they're better, etched in one of the calling cards is a phrase, "Of course never beats sipping wine to the scent of the salty sea"
- Also see a shiny rock, Yul wants ROCK, Yul is judging the rock aggressively until she feels a bit of shame
	- Yul also feels a magical sensation, you no longer desire the taste of sand, feel as though a core part of your values are being suppressed as the rock stares at Yul
	- Yul has acquired the rock of judgement
- See a house with a crazy witch hat on it 
	- The guy is opening the store, he's wearing a hat identical to the store
	- "Hellooo I haven't seen you around before"
	- Yul: I like the hat!
- Open door to see magical film, like a barrier
- Nim is emitting a big glow from her bag
	- The guy: ooh a curiosity I've never seen before! Do not worry! I have just constructed a little safe haven which should deactivate that particular item, it acts on things it has never detected before
	- Guy: hmmmm, looking at Nim, investigating Nim
	- Guy: Would you mind extracting the item?
	- Nim has 3 things that are glowing, 2 scrolls, 1 Hades summoning, 1 is the one in infernal, the 3rd is the magical gauntlet from Jeice 
	- Guy: please summon everything outside, but I'm interested in the gauntlet
	- Nim: You put it on, you point at people, and shoot spells
	- Guy: Wacky
	- Guy: Would you be willing to part with it? It seems like it has, â€¦, "bad juju"?
	- Guy: "The only person who would want that hand is the guild alchemist, and I sure as hell would like to drink with that"
	- Bloo: "What"
	- Guy: "what"
- Arcane focuses, hourglass with divination magic, a lyre in the back which has enchantment magic, has a lot of spell scrolls
	- Bloo asks for things to enchant spellcasting ability
	- Guy: has unfinished thing for enhancing distant magic, and also says he reminds me of someone, and asks if Bloo is looking for a staff
- 3 rings
	- 1 very bright, well chiseled and cut, circular, ruby, sense very strong enchantment magic, something to do with being likeable or perceived as likeable
	- Another one, strong conjuration magic, faint green glow, rhombus shaped
	- Last one just a silver band, sense conjuration magic as well
- Also a book, a catalog, a "demo version" of spells, spell scroll catalog
	- Nim wants a Teleport Circle scroll, can be done by the end of the day
- Staff allows use of misty step once per long rest, it leaves cherry blossom behind
- A pocket watch as a spellcasting focus, more like a pocket sundial, allows use of safer spell meta magic once per long rest
- Amulet when worn and attuned to, get distance spell once per long rest
- We walk down a humid staircase, smells a little of pollen, see half drank potion bottles down
- Sarah casts Zone of Truth, guy is not part of the league, fish cult, hades, etc.
- Nim asks about organizations who don't like the League, says there is an organization here, leader goes under the name "The Dawn" as its name, it's stupid
- Trades the gauntlet for the spell scrolls and whatnot
	- 1 Divination scroll
- Go to blacksmith
- There's 3 people in the trash diving alley, looking at us with suspicion, see someone rifling thru the trash can with suspicion
	- Another is talking, and the 3rd looks at us, there's something glowing in their hands as they put their hands together
	- They enter the street a few people behind, take their hood off and follow us
	- Nim: "you're bad at tailing us"
	- The guys: "you took something that is ours" and make a raised hand gesture, they pull off to the side and look at us with scorn
	- The guys: it's in that tiefling's pocket
	- Sarah: Oh lol we aren't affiliated
- Guy is still tailing Yul
- Yul tries to swallow the rock, fails, and has disappeared
- Blacksmith, walk in to see tall dragonborn, sarah cures his hangover, for a splint, helps to fix it up a little, and nim wants something magical
- Blacksmith calls the alchemist over
- Alechemist knows of us from Seliph, will do something with all the dragon scales horn and eye and basilisk stuff for a discount since we're on the commission 
- Wants us to grab herbs and stuff from the dock since the guy is icky about us going into the water
- Takes the dragon stuff for some potions and whatnot and enhancing the armor
- Needs catstail from the shore, the captain doesn't like me, definitely not because I'm a menace to the flora
- Tall and skinny man standing at port, very defensive about cattails, will be our captain tomorrow, offers 1GP for the cattails, he tells us not to tell Seliph or the alchemist
- Get the cattails, go back to the alchemist, tell her about the 1GP bribe
- Nim is getting bit by bugs
- We need to look for Yul
- Sarah casts locate object on Jeice's hand, senses that Yul is underground, towards the inner city
- Bloo casts Sending, "Where the fuck are you" to Yul
