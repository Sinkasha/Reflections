##### Important Things
- We find out where Yul is being held, bullshit the people there into us being clerics here to cure Yul of being a demon
- Turns out this cult, The Dawn, follows Fraltari (true name Felix), who took credit for the [[History of Faltera/214 CE - The Subjugation of Duessel Sarde\|subjugation of Duessel Sarde]] and has been frozen in ice for about 150 years. 
-  The praty makes Felix admit his mistakes as just the storyteller not the actual hero, and then make Bloo the head of the cult
- The shopkeeper we sold [[Characters/NPCs/Jeice]]'s gauntlet to was killed by [[Characters/NPCs/The Order of the Fish]], we follow them through the arcane gate to place something we can later use Locate Object with, finding out it is very deep underground
- Bloo reports it to VAC HQ
- Sarah's oath of vengeance is against the weird human on horse with chain monster
### 04.20.0347 Morning | Vasara
- One day before depart
- Yul wakes up, tied up, with a dim fire in front of her
- Two short men are looking at her
	- "I think we got a spy on our hands"
- Yul calls them short
	- Men: "Ah, a spy who is racist"
- They're halflings
	- Man: "Who do you serve?"
	- Yul: "Am I supposed to know that?"
	- Man: "I know who you are"
	- Yul: "I don't"
	- Man: "Tf you know"
	- Yul: "I woke up without memories"
	- Man: "Ah, bring the club"
	- Man: "Why are you here, in our town messing in our alley"
	- Yul: "I don't remember, I just remember going after a shiny rock and wanting to eat it"
	- Man: "This isn't working, bring in the club"
	- Man: "I want to know why you serve that freaky ass god"
	- Yul: "What god"
	- Man: "The fucken dead one, we saw what happened all the way over.. in Novis castle? We heard about that we know why you're here"
	- Pulls out a bubble with Theodore's head in his person
	- Man: "Why do you have this?"
	- Yul: "Why not??"
	- Man: "Man you know nothing"
	- Man points his dagger at Yul's neck
	- Yul asks if she can bite the dagger
	- Man: !?
	- Man: "tell me why" \*snaps his finger* "why might you be housing these"
	- Yul: "I woke up with those"
	- Man: "Do you know what the shards are for?"
	- Yul: "Nah just don't lick em"
	- Confused halflings
	- Man: "Ima rip the shards out of you"
	- Yul: "don't do that"
	- Man: "Hm? why? Who told you"
	- Yul: "I.. I forgot.. lady- lady uhm"
	- The man plunges the dagger into Yul's neck
	- Man: "The dagger is poisoned"
	- Man: "If you don't talk I'll just let the poison kill you and then extract the shards"
- 2 halflings knows the shards, knows what happened at Novis castle, wants the shards??
	- Man: "Why are you here, looking through our trash?"
	- Yul: "I like trash!"
	- "You can't eat the knife it's *in* your neck!"
	- Yul: loses consciousness
	- Sees halfling cracking his knuckles and pulling out another blade, it looks like a surgical knife
- Sarah's locate object is pointing towards the alleyway, so we all return to it
- There are two shady looking figures, arms crossed, leaning in the alley
- Trail of trash, some spit, and a shining rock in the middle of the street
- Nim: "Alright fuckers you took smth that's mine gimme it back"
	- The dudes: clear throat intensely, they look at each other, nod, look at Nim, nod
	- Nim picks up the rock on her way in
- We follow the trail of Yul's saliva, it leads into the dumpster
- Bloo notices a weird metal rod sticking out but isn't budging 
- Look into the pipe, see something red on the bottom
- Bloo blows into the tube, hear a sound transmitted into my head "incorrect"
- Bloo casts "detect thoughts" on one of them, Nim yells at them for the password and chucks garbage at them
	- Hear: The guards don't know the password
- Sarah gets out
- Bloo says: "Of course never beats sipping wine to the scent of the salty sea"
- Nim and Bloo are inside, all Sarah hears is a weird thud and some metal shifting around
- Nim and Bloo fall down a chute
- Bloo uses Sending to tell Sarah
- Now we are all in a trash pile, Sarah is much closer to the severed hand
- Narrow hallway, 2 doors to left, 1 door to right, thick steel door at the back
	- The hand is coming from the furthest non-steel door, door on the left at far end
- Big echo-y steps, hear voices, take a step, the stone sinks down, hear a click, and nothing else
- It's a wooden door
- Sarah cuts it down, it splinters
- See someone holding a club with rusty nails, no Yul
- Sarah: "Who the FUCK are you?!"
- The hand is on a table next to Theodore's head
- Sarah: "She's a demon who contracted brain damage, but we're gonna cure her and turn her back into a human"
	- Halfling: "wholeheartedly believes him"
	- "You're the clerics, oh the boss will be very happy to hear this"
	- Sarah just bullshits him
- The halfling grabs stuff from the desk, reactivates the bubble seal, hands it to Sarah
	- The demon is in the interrogation room, the boss is.. uh.. tried
	- He had to sedate her
	- "We are in a holy place, under the protection of our savior"
	- Sarah: "whomst?"
	- "The boss will be happy to get more converts!"
- The halflings takes us
- Nim thinks it may not be an actual god they're following
- Man: "Boss the clerics are here!"
- Boss: "Wow they work fast"
- The boss debriefs us, it has mirror shards, I know the legends, but we haven't seen it since the great hero has split the mirror and hid them all over the land
- Nim asks for bookkeeping, for information 
- Boss: "we have proof right here" right behind Yul is a human frozen in a block of ice
- Boss: "that is our savior!!! the one true god, the namesake of our land"
- From Nim's studies
	- Some weirdo who tried to take credit for the subjugation of duessel sarde
	- He is now frozen in ice
	- Based off his forged legacy, it seems to have spread beyond Dagdra
	- His name: Fraltari, but is fake name for publicity purposes, tried to steal legacy of three hidden heroes, tried to take credit since their bodies weren't found
	- The ice is not magical
- Boss: "Are you here to bless him??" 
- Sarah: "yeah fs fs"
- Nim: "We have secret holy symbols"
- Sarah carves a dick into the ice
- Sarah takes out the knife, and then casts "Lay on Hands" and cures the poison
- Nim puts the magic rock back in her pocket
- Sarah tells them that they can handle the "demon purification" from here
- Nim asks "you wouldn't happen to know where the shards are"
	- Boss: "Assuming they haven't been moved around, our savior, he's the one who split them"
- Bloo attempts to telepathic speech to him, only hear a stream of consciousness
	- Just talks about "get me out of here" "they're gonna kill me"
	- "They found out who I am"
	- Fearing for his life because someone found out his identity
	- He is unresponsive
- Sarah and Nim try to slash him out of the ice
- Sarah casts Lay on Hands, heals a poison or smth, he wakes up and starts breathing it up
- Nim expose his face so he can breath
- The dude kicking around, kicks his shoe and it flies into the back of Yul's head, who wakes up
- Nim: "Why are you pretending to be a god"
- Dude: "Oh god, are you with the fusillan government"
- The dude seems incredibly scared of Yul 
- Dude: "My name is Felix" "my stage name is Fraltari"
- Felix: "i've been in that ice for like, 150 years"
- Felix: "The last thing I remember is the coronation of the emperor at dagdra"
- Bloo: "You're like, 130 years off"
- Felix: "After the coronation I kept telling everyone I killed Duessel, and that thing, Yul, reeks of duessel"
- Bloo stabs him in the foot, for tarnishing the memories of the heroes
- Felix was being hunted down by assassins, bounty hunters? For falsifying historical records, probs assassins sent by the council of archmages
- Felix: the only body we saw was duessel
- Sarah: let's bring the cultists back
- Nim: you pretend to be the god
- Sarah unties Yul
- Yul: can I have my head back?
- Sarah: will you promise to be good?
- Yul: Yeeeessss
- Felix thinks "I can't believe I'm scared of this possible incarnation of duessel and it wants to eat rocks??!"
- Bring the cultists back in, who immediately bows down to Felix "oh great wise Fraltari, our salvation, and our answers"
- Felix: snaps his finger and turns his clothes into theater clothes, he snaps his finger and makes him shine, and then Nim uses minor illusion to turn him back into rags
- Cultists: "Will you help us against the god?"
- Nim: It's N it's N
- Felix: aight?? You get protection from N
- Yul: balls
- Felix: if you ever need my holy protection, just loudly yell, "Balls!"
- The cultists: "Balls!"
- The plan: Make Felix admit his mistakes as just the storyteller not the actual hero, and then make Bloo the head of the cult
- Felix: You two are sinners!!! You do not know the true god of your religion, I am just the messenger!! 
	- Felix casts testicular torsion
- Felix: I will release you when you recognize your true god (points to Bloo) my last wish is that you give this true hero your offerings of strawberry yogurt
	- FELIX INVENTED THE SPELL TESTICULAR TORSION
- Bloo busts open all the door, one has a crate and a bunch of papers, one has a big hole in the ceiling
	- Among the papers, callsign for the league of larcenists, for something they used to have
- Bloo demands the cultists to have better infrastructure, more people, better base
- We all walk to the resurfacing room, stand under the indent to the ceiling, we vwoop up, we gently float up to be right next to the trashcan
### 04.20.0347 Evening | Vasara

### 04.21.0347 Morning | Vasara
- Need to go pickup scrolls with the alchemist and blacksmith
- Serving all sorts of eggs for breakfast
- We go to the magic shop, all the lights are out
- The door is unlocked, hear glass shattering, smell metallic with smoke, someone's been busy
- The shopkeeper: "Oh hello! Wasn't expecting customers this early" 
	- Requested divination and teleportation circle scrolls
- The shopkeeper finally remembers
- The shopkeeper starts running into his store, "I got it! I remember now!"
- Shopkeeper: gives us envelope, with blood stained fingerprint, and it says "The Order shall prevail"
- Shopkeeper goes into his back room, and locks it
- It's a metal door
- Sarah hits the door, and blasts right through it
- The only person in the room is a familiar looking corpse with his finger cut off, the gauntlet is nowhere to be found
- The gauntlet is not within 1000 feet, but we hear some weird noises in the back, a hallway out the back of the lab
- Down the hallway, past all the papers, hear some whooshes, see some light, it's an arcane gate
- The shopkeeper wasn't super freshly killed, within the last 24 hours
- Arcane gate has 8 minutes left
- In a place deep underground, smell a bit of smoke, smell something very metallic, see some drops of blood that have been dried
- A disembodied index finger is lying down, in front of us
- There is magical darkness around us
- Rachel tries dispel magic on the darkness, the darkness is still there but you might've dispelled something
- Nim leaves her weird broken drumstick behind, and she hid it in a corner somewhere
- And then we leave via the arcane gate, back in the lab, see some papers on his desk, research notes on the gauntlet, see some blood
- His hand is clutching a paper, but it is the finished teleport circle scroll, the last thing he did before he died
- Sarah casts locate object on the drumstick, it is extremely deep underground, deeper than yul's time
- Bloo runs to the HQ, reports the Order crime to the VAC, gives them the envelope for evidence, she's super stressed about this information
- Nim walks into the blacksmith shop, "Seliph still hasn't arrived" Nim stares at them suspiciously
	- "Your order is ready!"
	- Nim: "Okay phew at least you know about my order"
	- Blacksmith: "Huh??"
- Got 3 different potions
	- A deep black tonic with glowing white strands that glitter, looks like a spiderweb, smells like burning hair, has no idea what it does
		- You don't need to ingest it, you can apply it on skin, or coat your weapon
		- She called it the essence of the spider dragon
		- 2 doses worth, 20% chance of smth going wrong
	- Presents a thick viscous black liquid, looks like tar, it's a potion of spider climbing, have to have at least 2 appendages touching a surface, works for about an hour, 2 doses
	- Glittery swirly blue liquid in a small vial, very small dose, this should cure any illness relating to decay, disease, poison, etc. make you temporarily more resistant to poisons, but only works on the living, 1 dose
- The blacksmith pulls out studded leather armor, studded with dragon scales
	-  Gives a little acid resistance
- Seliph trots up on a horse
- We tell them about the Order and the magic shop dude
- Seliph: For sarah's sake, I hope we get this monster slain
- We get to the boats
- We board the ship, sent to our quarters
- Each have our own room
- Yul examines Theodore's head, for the first time in her life, a thought entered her head, see a vision, see Theodore alive, see this shadow-y figure, Yul can't see who it is, feel a weird emotion, pride, in him, also sees other people, familiar people, thru Theodore, sees Jeice and the count, they're talking, nothing audible, suddenly you can tell you're somewhat important, in fact, you weren't supposed to die there, was theodore
- Yul licks the rock of judgement, hear a voice in your head, "now why would you lick a rock"
- Nim talks to Sarah, "would you like to tell us what this weird mythical creature is"
	- "And tell us why you hate it?"
	- Sarah: I just know it's a creepy ass mf, kinda looks like a human hunched over like a horse with a chain, makes a terrible sound
	- Sarah: This thing, I've encountered it before, I mean, I wasn't able to defeat it then I'm hoping to fix my mistakes
	- Sarah: this is from before I became a paladin, wasn't really a warrior, this thing, i dunno, I wasn't really involved in defense at the time
	- Sarah: I was lucky to get out alive, I dunno, I just have a responsibility to deal with it now
	- Sarah: I dropped out of school, became a paladin, swore an oath of vengeance against it
- The ship floats out to sea
- First mate, a silver dragonborn, she has perfect posture, a clipboard and pen, checking in on everyone
- The captains says there is a bar! A fancy ship chartered by the guild
- Children onboard the ship, two little gnomes
- Nim goes to the bar, gets mead, sits and watches
- Sailing quite smoothly

	- Puts one ice cube, water, and orange rind
-
