### 04.21.0347 Late afternoon | The Ship

- Boarded ship in late afternoon
- Ship of alistair wellspring
- Sarah, after drinking at the bar, goes back to her room, and hears a knock
- It's seliph, who wants to talk about attuning to the blade
  - I prayed to Claurus, about passing on the sword, but he had a bit of apprehension, but he wants to test your, in his words, worthiness
  - I don't think you have much to worry about it, should he approve, I'll begin de-attuning to it, but if he doesn't, welp
  - You'll need to go thru his trial
- Sarah agrees to try tonight
- Seliph asks sarah to prioritize her own life over slaying the beast
- Bloo is standing on the deck, seliph walks up
- Bloo: no strawgurt :(
- Seliph: pulls out a strawgurt jar, bought a couple, ate a couple
- Seliph hands me an envelope, it clings, sounds like metal, open it when you can
- Bloo: all the locations need more strawberry yogurt
- Seliph: lol I can do that
- Seliph: next time we see astrid she wanted to show you that dynamo is being preserved, she didn't want to give it to anyone else
- Patron starts calling everyone to dinner
- Tall slender woodelf, chatting up the other patrons, a couple humans
- A deep gnome, who's twiddling his thumbs waiting to be served, looks a little nervous
- Next to him see someone wearing elegantly crafted plate armor, the helmet has quite the striking design, made out of unique alloy, inside under the helmet, his eyes are a deep gray, it's an aasimar, looks brooding, zoning out
- Seliph is at head of table next to Captain Alistair, starts bringing out a large bone-in slab of meat
- The deep gnome springs up, and runs over
- Nim walks up to the deep gnome, who gets his meat, which is a human sized portion, for a small gnome
- The deep gnome looks very wired, "I'm just heading home"
  - Nim: "where's home"
- Deep gnome looks at sarah, and now deep gnome looks more tense
- Right behind Yul is the aasimar, who towers over her, who is on the high end of height
- Yul bonks into the plate
- Aasimar: oh sorry
- Yul: you're very tall
- Aasimar: thank you
- Yul: Sarah you're short!!!!!!!
- Sarah: Whaaattt?
- Yul: Yipppeeee
- Aasimar hears a rumor about a tiefling flaunting dismembered body parts and being stitched up

- Aasimar: I'm gabriel, from thalum mercenary guild, sent by, well an envoy of the emperor
- Gabriel: I heard about lapis and lazuli being beaten up by a paladin
- Sarah: ehe lol
- Gabriel: cassandra is a tough woman, and people yearn for that recognition, I find people get better when they stop giving a shit
- Yul
- Gabriel: that might be the evil I detected
- Nim: what about bloo???
- Walk to the deck
- Deep gnome, wood elf tried to talk to it, deep gnome isn't as scared, likely just scared of aasimars
- Deep gnome walk to the bar, grabs a massive mug of ale, slowly sips the mug
- Yul attempts to climb the mast, but is quickly stopped by patron, who looks over judgingly
- Yul pulls out the rock, the rock has no judgement, because Patron is correct
- Nim keeps studying
- Yul follows and T-poses over Nim
- Gabriel walks over to Sarah
  - "There's more than just a visit home for you"
  - Sarah: "how do u know where I'm from"
  - Gabriel: "just a guess, don't usually see aasimars"
- Gabriel warns sarah against acting in revenge or acting too rashly
- Hear footsteps outside Nim's door, enter a door, but the only nearby door is Yul's
- Nim goes with Yul to make sure no one steals her corpse chunks
- They run over, see Yul's door is open
- Nim sticks her head in
- "Is the tiefling back"
- Nim: "You shouldn't walk randomly into people's rooms"
- Gabriel sits on the floor
- Gabriel: have you figured out how this head works?
- Yul: no
- Gabriel: a bit of advice, tosses a can to Nim, bug spray is free, you might want to check your neck
- Nim feels something crawling on his neck
- Gabriel: I suggest you should be more observant, I thought academics should be more observant
- Nim: only what we're researching
- Gabriel: I won't interrupt your time staring at the corpse, if this is your way of training yourself, it's a fool's errand, in one word, describe this head
- Yul: brain cell provider
- Gabriel pats you on the shoulder as he walks out, "you best wise up, the enemy is stronger than you can imagine" and walks away
- Something is whizzing around Nim, and when she swats at it it disappears
- Nim goes to look for Sarah
- Nim knocks on Sarah's door, "I've got a magic bug on my neck"
- Sarah: "that's not really my specialty"
- Sarah sees nothing
- Nim investigates the bug spray, it's normal bug spray
- Nim notices a spot on her neck feels weird
- There is a purple dot on Nim's neck
- Suddenly, Sarah smells and senses something, smells something sinister, there's a sudden unnatural storm
- Hear captain yell "we're in a storm! Shite, everyone down into your decks, I'll handle this"
- Hear lightning, hear the captain say, "aww shite who are you"
- Hear rain, the ship is rocking back and forth, hear a cackle
- Random: "This ship has something of mine!!"
- Nim sprays the bug bite with the bug spray and runs upstairs
- Yul follows
- See captain and seliph, "who here has my ring, that is mine"
- Suddenly, she points "you, unholy paladin, give me back my ring" see, floating well above in the air, see a hunched wide framed figure, it has very long slender fingers that droop down, bony finger, pointing at Sarah, in her right hand is a slender rod, "give me back my ring"
- Sarah: "What ring"
- "I sense that someone here wore my ring without permission"
- Sarah, gives the ring back
- She snaps her finger and points her rod at it, it slips onto her bony left ring finger, "What did you do to my ring?? You tainted it, it was filled with my love"
- She calls Sarah unholy, "you and your unholy gods, you shall be punished" she snaps with her left finger, lightning strikes the hull of the ship
- She is shooting lightning out of her rod
- "What did you do to my ring??"
- Sarah: "All I did was wear it"
- Thing: "if you jump off the ship, you can atone for it"
- Sarah: "If I do will you leave everyone alone?"
- She's prepping to shoot a lightning bolt at the ship regardless
- Nim shoots her
- She points her staff straight at the ship, it starts to crackle lightning
- 250 feet away
- Yul flips her off
- Sarah flies up towards her
- The lightning shoots straight down and pierces the ship
- It charges up once more, something in Nim's bag begins to glow blue
- Hear a whisper in your bag "heed my call, gather your allies within a sword's reach, brace for impact, I will protect you"
- Nim: yells at everyone to come towards her, Sarah flies back
- As the shadowy figure shoots another lightning bolt, the ship starts to capascize, a water ball forms around you, and starts to harden, "What!? It can't be!" see her shoot another lightning bolt and it just streams around your protective sphere, and then she vanishes, and then all 3 of you feel a large shake
- We all wake up on a deserted island, feel cold, water begins dripping down onto you, waking you up
- You 3 are still in the water ball which pops
- Your feet fall into the sand, it's warm, see a tortle corpse sitting right next to you, and a jar of bloo in the palm tree
- See a tall black pillar in the middle of the island
- Yul feels different, the rock of judgement is in front of her, you remember, the joys of eating sand, as she sits in sand
- Yul looks at the rock of judgement in the eye and starts eating sand
- The rock floats up and puts itself in Yul's pocket
- Nim still has a glow in your pocket
- A puddle of water that has shapeshifted into the sapphire you lodged in the previous ruins, it's still glowing, it flows out amorphously into a stream and reshapes itself into a sapphire
- It floats towards the black pillar
- Nim pokes it, it feels like water
- Bloo goes back to the tortle corpse
- The sapphire says, "follow"
- See the wreckage of the ship, see no bodies in the water
- Make it to the pillar, the sapphire unstrands into water, begins to glow with blue accents, hear the sound of stone receding into the ground, it opened!
- The sapphire: "Enter!" the voice is feminine
- Go the ship, the wreckage looks bleak, a silver dragonborn is unconscious or dead, Patron :(
  - She's not breathing
- Hear someone coughing, it's the captain
- Do not see the seliph
- Manage to yank the captain out, his legs are broken
- Nim gives captain minor healing potion
- Captain: "This is the worst incident, first time I've ever capsized"
- Look through the wreckage, see some salty and bloody dismembered limbs
- Still do not see Seliph
- See, in the water, see something shiny
- See gabriel's helmet in the water
- Sarah gets a weird sensation with the helmet, it feels sinister
  - Can't identify what specifically, feels an evil imprint
  - Less of the helmet being crafted in an evil way
- See a bottle with a piece of paper, sealed the cork
- Nim feeds Yul the cork, then reads the message
  - “….it was unnatural. The way it contorted. Screamed. He saved me from the beast, but at what cost. He subdued it, enough time for me to get out. I wish I could thank him, but I don’t know if he made it. It’s still out there.”
  - No other living creatures on this island
- Sarah puts Yul in her backpack
- The captain sits up
- Bloo casts Sending to Seliph
  - Seliph responds, "I might be somewhere else, glad to know you're alive, I'm also on an island, idk how far away"
- See nothing but water on the horizon
- Nim: tells the captain to rest and then see if you can salvage anything
- We all enter the obelisk, it closes, and then it's lit up, and starts to glow blue, it begins to descend
- We exit the elevator, notice an encapsulated bubble, it's flowing back and forth, the walls are permeable, you can walk through them, but it takes you to salt water, on the ground, Nim recognizes the outer symbol, part of a sigil representing Azathoth, the inner represents water
- Hear a voice, "Please, explore below and help me"
- See fishies swimming around
- Please, stand on the sigil, see for yourself
- Nim and Bloo stand on the sigil, the floor begins to swirl, you all start sinking into the floor and start spinning into the spiral
- We all get whirlpooled elsewhere, see a glowing spiral on the floor slowly fade away
- The walls beside are stone, but in front it's gelatinous, it's water
- You press on the water, and you can go inside
- The spiral has faded
- Sapphire: "enter the bubble"
- The bubble is moving, we are stuck in place
- The bubble carries us across, and then it's floating in a giant room, and then the bubble pops
- Start falling into this water pit
- We all somewhat gracefully fall in
- See light coming in from the right side
- There is a hallway, see a frostladen floor, with a door
- There's a pit on the other side, about 20 feet wide
- Misty step past the pit, see 2 buttons
- Bloo presses the one on the right, nothing happens
- Press one on left, the pit fills with water, hear water rushing to the left, Sarah is now submerged in water in the big room we landed in
- Bloo tries to use rope to yank Sarah to the dry side but fails
- Sarah tries to get out too, but can't
- Yul presses the left button again, does nothing
- Yul presses the right button, see the pit draining
- The hallway is frosty because there is something very cold on the other side of the wall
- Sarah exits the big pit
- Bloo swims to the bottom of the small pit, see an opaque blue, the pit took me 2 whole minutes to swim to the bottom of the water
- Bloo swims to the top of the beeg pit, everyone follows
- There's another hallway at the top
- Nim recognizes the symbol, elemental goddess of water
- On left see a relief, a picture of someone
- On the right see a dining table with 10 chairs
-
