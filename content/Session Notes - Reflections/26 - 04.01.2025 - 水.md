##### Important Points: 
### 04.21.0347 Late Afternoon | Sunken Temple
- Water ripple can only be passed thru if there's solid land to push off of, like a solid bubble
- Check room on left with the art
	- Four reliefs, Left to right
	- Feminine figure cross hands with flowing water between them
	- Standard portrayal of , dignified portrayal in front of river
	- A blocking motion covering her face, with her arms in front of her, blocking with her palms forward
	- Final one on right has left hand outward, palm up, looks determined
	- Altar in front with turquoise fabric
- Nim is glowing purple and grabbing at her bug bite, "not feeling too good"
- Nim: depictions of [[Religion of Faltera#Goddess of the Water Thetis\|Thetis]], elemental goddess of water, altar, mostly used for offerings, but then up to us to figure out what, an offering and a rite
- Remember must recite a prayer to her in her cathedral for her offering to be accepted
- Depictions are trying to tell a story, story not well known
- Thetis appreciates offerings of mortal sentimental value
- Yul offers a banana, but we don't know the prayer
- Bloo goes to the other room with the dining table, smell a whiff of alcohol, see a big wooden dining table with wooden chairs, room was a gathering room for feasts of the disciples, untouched in some time
- There is a door at the top of this room, Bloo opens it and goes through, wine cellar, smell dust and wine, no one in here for centuries, a slip of paper straight in the front, Bloo pulls it out
	- To whom it may concern, the boiler is down. There was a pipe burst on Floor B7. Flammable gas is contained within the room. Please exercise caution before attempting to reignite the boiler. 
	- Water tank and boiler valve located on Floor B6.
	- We are currently on floor B4
- Also torn pieces of paper, 4 pieces, each have one line on them
	- Oh great seal (3)
	- I purge the darkness (4)
	- flowing healing water (1)
	- divine streams of life (2)
- See a couple bottles that actually have liquid in it
	- Bloo drinks it, tastes like the most divine wine ever, taste a nice dry wine, pleasant grapey aftertaste, however it's just water that tastes like wine
- A parchment next to the bottle, it is written in Celestial, Sarah can read it
	- Thetis, I implore you to submerge your palace and seal it away. I fear we are amidst a conflict upon our very pantheon. Since the fusions, your powers have not been what they used to be. I will contain your essence in this Sapphire, trusting my descendants will awaken you once more. Guide them here, help them revive you. Even if we slay him now, his descendants will seek revenge. We cannot afford to lose you, our master of water. 
	- May have been written by Azathoth, or a transcript of a conversation
- Bloo looks for more paper, all other slips are torn or soaked, thus unreadable
- Go down the hallway, feel something cloud your vision, some force is pushing you back
- We pour water on the symbol at the intersection of the hallway, it begins to glow blue, the water magically flows into the waterskin, the water is now glowing slightly blue
- Bloo pours the glowing water into the glass jar, looks thru it, nothing
- Bloo pours the glowing water on the symbol again, now the floor is wet
- Get glowing water, put in jar, go up to dead-end hallway, nothing changes
- Splash the water towards the darkness, the water goes in, don't hear a splash, no sound, the water looks like it got absorbed
- Yul gets glowing water, pours it on herself, tries to walk through the end of the hallway, and makes it into the darkness
- She needs to concentrate as she feels swarms of arcana and magic attacking her, decipher some things
- Hear words flowing through your brain, head hurty, she collapses onto the ground
- See the vision of the reliefs from the previous room, see Thetis flowing water between her hands, pouring it into a river, blocking her hands forwards, and reaching her hands out, it's animated
- See the motions she goes through, hear her saying something but can't quite make it out, a line per relief, casts something out, and then the darkness vanishes, and then the darkness kicks Yul back out
- Yul goes into the room with the reliefs, and says: 
	- flowing healing water (1)
	- divine streams of life (2)
	- Oh great seal (3)
	- I purge the darkness (4)
	- Hear something get drained away, and something across the hallway drain away
- See another water barrier where the hallway dead end was
- Bloo dives into the water, see a water barrier in front of me and on the right side of the room (my left), at Sunken Temple B5, it's pretty deep, at least 15+ ft. deeper 
- Room on left is flooded, no water barrier
- Water barrier on right side and bottom side hallway
- Yul pushes Nim down (Nim: "God damn it!!"), then jumps down too
- Sarah cannonballs in in a suit of armor (lol) and makes a massive ripple
- Bloo investigates the bottom hallway, see a very ornate stone door, opens it
- We are in a cathedral! (entered from side)
- Statues of Thetis in the back of the cathedral
- At the front see a shrine, nothing on it
- Behind the shrine, see a weird indentation on the wall, weird energy emanating from it, look up and around and see stained glass all around you, feel weird heat almost, look up and see stained glass
- See scripture, etched into the glass, in Ancient Falteran: 
![[../Pasted image 20250401181206.png|600]]
- Locked door at back of cathedral
- We drag Nim over to let her pick the lock, she gets an interesting feeling from the door, "are you sure you want me to lock pick this"
- Bloo recites the incantation in the cathedral, hear off in the distance, feel a wave of magical power
- Bloo investigates the room to the right of the tank
	- See bench, coffee table, and a old looking box
- Bloo shoves the old box open, it has ice crystal, moss, and a heavy slate
- Inside find a key on the bottom, and 3 bottles of wine
	- The key hasn't been used in a while, rusted, the key feels weirdly cold
	- The top of the box also felt weirdly cold
	- The closer to the box, the colder it got
	- Bloo sips some wine, strongest wine you've ever had, you taste it, it has been aged a long time
	- Bloo hands this bottle to Sarah, who chugs it, it tastes pretty good
- Bloo helps Sarah shove the box aside, underneath is a slip of paper, kind of rolled up as we shoved the box away, as well as some ice crystals, but the note itself is not wet
- Note: please fix the boiler instead of getting drunk, I am sick of being here in the freezing cold
- The room has gotten colder the longer we are in here
- ![[../Pasted image 20250422115213.png|600]]
- The  wall at the top of the room with the box is a little frosty
- Bloo touches the wall with their left hand, your hand is cold and it feels like i touched a solid block of ice
- We take Nim's pickaxe, and jam it towards the wall, which gets the pickaxe stuck in the wall, but didn't get a lot of depth
- Bloo eldritch blasts the wall, nothing happens
- We go back to the cathedral, Yul offers another banana, see the banana start to glow blue, the banana is now floating in the air above the altar
- Behind the altar, feel a magical pulse from both sides, the wall and the banana
- Bloo mage hands the banana, and holds it to the wall, but touching the banana made it not glow
- Inscription on statue in side of cathedral: 
- ![[../Pasted image 20250401184505.png|600]]
- It says: "aqua vitae thetis" 
- We put wine on the altar, from in the other room
- Hear a high pitched hum, see the wine slowly lift out of the bottle, swirling around the banana, slowly enclose the banana, now there's a thin veil of wine over the banana and it's seeping in
- And now the banana starts to contort, and it slowly descends into Yul's hands, who now has a purple glowing banana
	- It is radiating a very strong arcane presence 
- We move the banana closer to the indent behind the altar, we poke it into the indent, and it gets slurped in, the wall breaks apart, revealing a room, with 3 wine bottles, with an inscription above in Celestial: "take only one"
	- Each bottle has a different label
	- Top: To protect 
	- Middle: To preserve
	- Bottom: To enact revenge/vengeance 
	- The room seems to be a storage room, but also a vault
	- See some random coins on the ground, Bloo picks them up, picks up 23GP
- We call Nim over, and indicates this is the treasure room of Thetis
	- Certain gods have special offerings for rewards for those who give an offering in turn
	- We may only take one, but each of these is an elixir of sorts
	- She doesn't know what each one does
- Bloo takes the bottle "to protect" and the other pedestals sink back into the ground
- A bottle of wine labeled "to protect"
- Bloo sniffs it, it smells like wine
- Bloo takes a small sip, feel the power of the wine going through you, extremely strong, it doesn't taste like wine or alcohol, it tastes more like a potion, has this very strong aftertaste of banana wine, exhaling a blue puff of smoke, eyes glow blue, just standing there frozen, feel this weird surge of vitality
	- your own body feels lighter than before, feel stronger connection with corpse I've hijacked, feel as those I'm more durable
	- Look back into the bottle, there's nothing left, however Bloo is still glowing blue
	- Bloo is enchanted, gain 5 temporary hp after every long rest, and until Bloo next long rest, and get +1 to AC
- Bloo uses the key to unlock the door at the end of the cathedral, but the key snapped
	- We mend the key to get it back
- Leads to hallway that goes into water pit, another 15 ft. down
- Go back to the other pit, take the left hallway, wade through some water into a very tall room with two boxes stuck to the ceiling, about 40 feet up
- Bloo uses eldritch blast on both boxes, one breaks open and some papers drop out, and something with cloth flops out the other one
- Papers are spell scrolls, 2 are Create Water (not destroy), 1 Bless
- Yul hides in the corner, sees Bloo look up, jump straight up, a puff of mist and teleports 30 feet straight up, cast mage hand, sees a flick of the wrist as Bloo's mage hand pulls out a cloak and it drapes and falls right onto Bloo
	- Navy blue colored cloak
	- The Cloak of Water Immersion
	- Once per long rest, to slip into a puddle of water as small as 5 x 5 ft., depth of 1 inch, considered invisible in that pool of water, can remain for 1 minute
- We go back down the pit, and fall all the way down to B7
- Water barrier on top hallway, none on left hallway, long ass crawlspace in top right corner
- Left hallway, narrow passageway, nothing but black beneath us, water film barrier across the pit, at a higher altitude than we currently are, 5-10 feet higher than us, down below is just black
- Bloo throws a pebble with Light on it down the pit, it just disappears, hear no sound no nothing
- Top hallway, pass through the barrier, small room (empty), leads into a longer ish hallway
- Take a yogurt jar of the air, go back into the water pit, mage hand it up to try to use dagger against stones to spark into it, nothing happens
- Drop a match from the tinderbox into the jar, nothing happens
- Go back into the hallway, the right side makes a u-turn, at end is a control panel, three labels and three buttons
	- Labels: B5, B6, B7
- Left side leads to another hallway that leads to another pit of water, that has a hallway across and to the right
- Also leads to a water film barrier, but can step back and forth through it
- See another control panel
	- Says: B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7
	- Which leads back to the original pit with the opening that was 5-10 ft. up
- At the end of the crawlspace, is a vent, hear a gas hissing
- The vent is stuck
- Go back to the pit of the water, bloo takes the right hallway, it's dark through the film, bloo casts light, see a locked door, unlock it with mended key, opens it, hears gas hissing, see the boiler, see broken pipe
- Sarah inhales the gas, goes outside the room, breathes out on a torch, exhales a small puff of fire
- Sarah casts mending on the pipe
- We fixed the gas leak
- Hear a sudden rush of water from the previous room, the entire previous rooms are now flooded
- We take the vent back to the unflooded pit
- Bloo goes to the first control panel, inoperable under water
- Sarah swims straight up to B6, Sarah smashes a locked door, see another button, and a closed valve
- Sarah opens the valve, hear some steam coming out, feel a surge of heat from the boiler, hear some water flowing
- Sarah presses the button, nothing happens
- Sarah goes through a door, entering a big room
- On a display, Sarah sees a map, that shows the entire place and how it's connected
- Sarah presses a button, and Yul's water pit that leads to the 5-10ft. higher hole is now flooded, and can now make it to the higher hallway
- Yul notices something weird about the walls, she pokes them, it's a fake wall, hits a switch, and the illusion fades
- See a light at the end of the hallway, don't know what's in the middle of the hallway, casting light on stone and tossing it in, it is magical darkness
- Yul sees her pebble end up on the other side though
- Bloo joins Sarah, on B6, taking the bottom hallway and going around leads to the display room
- Yul clicks B7 on the control panel, and the water level has drained, all previously flooded areas have dried up, and the tank where Sarah and Bloo were, that tank has only 10 ft. deep of water
- Display: ![[../Pasted image 20250401195425.png]]
- Sarah and Bloo are in the boiler room next to B6 Central tank
- Nim and yul are also in the maintenance room closer to B7 southern tank
- Boiler has been turned in, so the frozen water valves and library are now no longer frozen
-
