  - [[Characters/PCs/Yul]]
  - [[Characters/PCs/Sarah]]
- Previous session: [[Session Notes - Reflections/26 - 04.01.2025 - æ°´]]

##### Important Points:

- Who's Prometheus? Note about Prometheus being saved by their sister?
- [[Characters/NPCs/Gabriel]] has been tracking us, and then turned the water elemental against us and intends to kill us to kill all witnesses

### 04.21.0347 Late Afternoon | Sunken Temple

- Sarah and Bloo were in B6
- Nim and Yul are in B7, next to control panel
- Nim is pulsing purple
- Map from last session: 
![[Pasted image 20250401195425.png]]
- Nim would like to walk towards the light behind the secret wall
- Yul ties Nim to a rope and Nim walks towards it
- Nim is in magical darkness, and makes it through into the light
- Nim unties the rope
- At the end of the hallway is a dusty box, Nim goes to open it, it's locked, the lid is stuck and the lock is rusty
- Nim uses her crowbar to pry it open, not before feeling a release of gas pop open, there was some pressure in the box
- Nim fails to sneeze
- 2 folded parchment in the chest
- Nim reaches in, feels like it's being submerged in ice cold water, manage to grab the papers, now feels like her hand is on fire
- Nim yanks her hand out, it looks like it's still on fire, but no pain, but your entire lower arm is on fire and radiating light
- Nim walks towards magical darkness, the fire goes away, back in the light the fire returns
- Yul hi fives the flaming hand, it does not burn Yul
- Nim feels compelled to do impulsive things, feel an urge to find shiny things, very strong urge
- Nim tries to rifle through Yul's pockets for shiny things as Yul runs away
- They chase each other around the control panel

### Sarah and Bloo, Map Room

- Insufficient amount of water to make it past the main hall
- The reservoir below is low on water
- Bloo opens a box, there's a key, slightly rusted over key, key that would unlock either a chest (really large lock)
- Bloo and Sarah jump into the middle tank to floor B7, go through top water barrier
- See effigy of Thetis on left, see 2 boxes, a small crate and a large chest
- Bloo tries key on small crate, the box opens
  - Inside is a note saying "to always keep the boiler on, otherwise the uppermost floors are at risk of freezing"
- Key doesn't open large chest
- Nim chased Yul into the room
- On the right side there's a massive thick sheet of ice
- Nim picks the lock, but it fails
- Nim tries to pick the lock again, and manage to open it!
- Inside, it appears to be empty
- Nim holds her magical flaming arm in the chest, see that it's starting to melt the bottom of the box, which was plated in armor
- See text burning through, appears to be some weird message that pops up, but it's in Celestial
- Bloo: "SAAARAAAHHH"
- Sarah: "Wtf happened to your arm"
- Sarah: "I will save you Prometheus" signed "Your sister"
- Nim retracts her hand, the message fades
- Yul: "Nim you should run towards the ice wall!!" (ice wall on the right)
- Nim tries to go back towards the chest, but it's no longer there
- Nim walks out of the magical darkness, and her arm no longer appears to be on fire and she no longer has an urge to have shiny things
- The hidden corridor is gone
- Boiler, there is a slot at the bottom of the gas panel, for a key
- Bloo tries their key and give it a turn
- Suddenly hear metal clanking and sparks and some heat, see that the boiler is emitting light, it appears as if the boiler is on!
- We can now go through the ice wall from the previous room, there is a valve
- Sarah turns the valve, everything suddenly starts to feel a lot warmer, hear in the distance water sprinkling down into the pool (plip plip plip)
- Bloo's key doesn't work on either chest in the room past the ice wall
- Nim picks the lock of the bottom chest, Bloo and Nim peer into the chest, it appears to be a horde of gold, but this is just an illusion, and there are melting ice cubes in it, there also appears to be a claw in it
- Nim high fives the claw, nothing happens
- Nim picks up the claw, it appears to be a creature that you haven't seen before, but it looks like it's related to a creature we've met
- Nim gives it to Yul
- It's a pale blue-ish white, very bony
- Nim tries to pick up an ice cube, it's organic somehow
- Yul tries to smell the ice(?), in this context, the ice is analogous to blood(?)
- Yul gets 12 ounces of ice/water/blood/organic material(?)
- Nim picks the lock to the top chest, which opened a lot easier than the other one, hear a screech and a weird creature flies up, it appears very sickly
- It immediately starts attacking Nim
- Tries to attack Nim, bloo silvery barbs (advtg to Sarah), Sarah and Nim attack it, it explodes and shatters
- That was a Mephit, it appears the bottom chest had the corpse of a Mephit
- Nim notices an opening at the bottom of the southern tank
- Nim raises the water level to B6
- Sarah and Bloo go back to the map room
- New map: 
![[Pasted image 20250423195359.png]]
- Indicator in reservoir flashing
- Bloo and Sarah go back to floor B7
- Bloo is looking at the southern tank room, sees a tunnel that has opened
- We all swim down
- We all see a water elemental standing in the center, we are all no longer underwater, there was a water elevator
- The water elemental judges us
- Yul uses the rock of judgement, the water elemental does not mean us any harm
- It tries to approach, but before it can approach, hear a noise
- Nim is glowing an extremely vibrant purple
- Nim feels a weird pulsing sensation on her neck where she got bit
- We all hear a familiar voice, "so you show yourself here at last, I figured I would find you"
- At the opposite end of the room, we see the fallen aasimar, Gabriel
- He looks at us: "you certainly made it easy to track, I can't believe that worked, I thought you were astute adventurers, it made my life so much easier, is there anyone else I must slaughter to prevent witnesses? Tell me, why are you here? Why did you come to Thetis's temple?"
- Nim: "Cause a blue stone told us to"
- Gabriel: "Well you could've simply perished, but that's not my problem, hand over the Sapphire and I'll let you go free"
- Nim: "Nah"
- Gabriel: "I take it you head for half moon bay after this, I hope to see you again, but for now, I'll leave you a parting gift, leave the sapphire here and I'll collect it from your corpses later, oh and don't bother trying to find me, I'll love the pleasure of killing you, Alright, I'll give you a nice gift, enjoy it!"
- Gabriel shoots the water elemental, "Now die for me, goodbye!" and vanishes
- And now the water elemental was blasted with a necrotic ray, it now has adorned armor and it appears to glow purple (same shade as Nim)
- It screams and summons two water weirds
- Bloo casts Armor of Agathys sometime here
- Glowing purple, bug injected something in Nim so Gabriel could track them

### Combat with Ruined Water Elemental

- **Nim**: shoots the elemental, and then asks thetis for help from the sapphire, "Sorry he interrupted my control over the elemental, you'll have to do this on your own, just try to hold out as long as you can"
- **Bloo**: casts Hunger of Hadar
- **Water Elemental**: Hear a weird shink of ice sound coming from the middle of the Hunger of Hadar, the elemental pokes his head outside
- **Yul**: Guiding Bolts the elemental, its armor has been cracked a little
- **Sarah**: Dashes and runs towards the elemental
- **Nim**: shoots again, pierces it right where it was glowing, now no longer glowing
- **Bloo**: Mirror Image, Mind Sliver (quickened), silvery barbs (advtg to Sarah)
- **Water Weird**: Grapples bloo, destroys Armor of Agathys, 3 bloo clones left
- **Water Elemental**: Tail that tethers it to water, swings blade down on Sarah, who silvery barbs, completely misses, feel an irradiating aura from its blade but Sarah is immune!
- **Yul**: moves back a little, guiding bolt water weird that's grappling Bloo
- **Sarah**: Abjure the extraplanar, hits the elemental and one water weird, they will run from Sarah unless they take damage before their turn, notices a sense of remorse and reluctance from the mermadon/elemental, as though it doesn't want to do this and it's glad it's being forced by Sarah's divine power
