##### Important Points: 
- Gabriel is aligned with N
- Thetis says our best bet against N is to revive Azathoth
### 04.21.0347 Late Afternoon | Sunken Temple | Combat with Ruined Water Elemental
- **Nim**: Shoots the water weird that is grappling Bloo
- **Bloo**: Mind slivers the weird
- **Water Weird**: Tries to down Bloo by dragging bloo down into the water
- **Yul**: Guiding bolts "uwu", bloo silvery barbs, yul hits, advtg. to sarah, kills the water weird, Bloo takes a comically large breath upon resurfacing (as do the mirror images)
- **Sarah**: Attacks the water elemental with a marking(?) smite twice
- **Water Elemental**: teleports to Nim and Yul, Yul feels sick near the elemental, in an area around the water elemental, the armor it is wearing and the sword it carries is what's emitting this necrotic energy, Yul's hands are starting to decay at the fingertips, takes a step towards Nim, swings twice, hits on the second swing, Nim also feels the same intense necrotic aura, across Nim's body, there's a weird flesh rot, it's shallow for now, swings at Nim again, hits
- **Water Weird 2**: tries to chomp Yul, misses
- **Nim**: Thunderwaves the elemental, disengages then runs away towards Sarah (opposite direction of Bloo
- **Bloo**: Tasha's mind whips big elemental, hits, then 2 blasts of eldritch blast, misses one hits the other, genie's thunder wrath rahhh
- **Yul**: Does the *Yul strafe*, crab walks 180 degrees around the water weird to no longer be sandwiched, slashes with the fan, leaving a shock behind
- **Sarah**: moves 30 feet towards the big elemental, smites twice, CRITS, the water elemental turns purple as it slowly dissolves away, the armor falls into the water, dissolving into purply-black fizz and into a gaseous form, as it dissipates into smoke
- Everyone's gaping necrotic flesh wounds are regenerating back into their normal selves
-  **Nim**: Shoots the water weird
- **Bloo**: walks up to the weird, taunts the weird, slaps it with the chill touch skeletal hand it starts disintegrating, bloo picks it up with the skeletal hand, and slaps it again with their own hand, it lands face down and disintegrates
- The water level is rising
- We all swim to the center tube as we all get swept up, we all fwoosh up to the top, we're at the b3 level
### 04.21.0347 | Floor B3
- We are at the library
- See neatly organized shelves, there must be hundreds of books in this tiny room, in center is fountain with plaque, which reads, "Catalog, pick a section "fiction", "academic", and "reference", the plaque appears to be touch screen
- Hit the button for academic, see a bunch of glowing books that are academic
- "Wave Patterns", a collection of illustrations of tidal waves, notes connection between lunar cycle and tidal waves
- The slot where Nim took the book isn't where the book goes, there is a slot where it should go, it should be closer to the other side
- The second book "On Prometheus and Thetis", "Fire and water, two birds of a feather. Sibling gods who often bickered. Thetis, compassionate and methodical; Prometheus, determined and impulsive."
- The book was already in the correct position
- The third book: "Merely a chronicle of events" it's a ledger of the people who came to this church (the temple we're standing in)
- Nim returns the tides book to the right position, part of the bookshelf retracts and slides into the wall
- Dark hallway, leads to the break room, where librarian can rest, portrait of marine animals, on back wall see drinking fountain with button
- Bloo goes up to the fountain, "slorp slorp", gets 4d4+4 temp health
- Nim drinks, gets 4d4+4 health
- Yul drinks, gets 2 temp 3rd level spell slots
- Sarah drinks, regain 1st and 2nd level spell slot
- Bloo and Yul drink the water in the fountain
- For "reference", see a thick journal glowing blue, hastily written journal with diff colors, diagram of relationships of people and church / people of Thetis, heads of respective churches are siblings, the two heads are the descendants of the gods themselves, which makes them cousins, Adrianna Lâ€™dore and Leonard Fisbach (potentially related to the fusillan queen and )
- Scratched out name on the journal, Gerald Fisbach, Valzelian inquisitor has fisbach surname
- The scratched out name has initials PW
- Titled "diary of a chronic overthinker"
- One big book still glowing, it is a cookbook, it is very thick, it must be 300 pages long, titled "Soups, meals for many", used to be owned by the head of church
- The book is split into section, split into genre of broth, fish broth, chicken broth, hearty stews, mixed broth, and potat section
- Notice smth weird when flipping through mixed broth, one specific recipe, "The Big Game Broth", it is a hearty broth not for the faint of heart, this broth promises to invigorate, and included recipe
- Sucrose sap tree, very rate, only found at frostwind and celestial peak (where cold), sap is white and sweet as sugar, sap has property of invigoration, but recipe calls for leaf part not sap
> **Big Game Broth:** A hearty broth not for the faint of heart. Straight from the bones of large gamey creatures, this broth will invigorate you.
> Hack 3 pounds of ox bones and 2 pounds of beef bones. Rinse thoroughly until no more blood or meat remains. Bring 2 liters of water to a bubble in the biggest pot you have. While that boils, light a small flame and toast the bones until brown. If you are magically inclined, arrange the bones in a circle with a half meter radius. Cast a simple Fire Bolt in the center twice, or until desired roast is achieved. Deposit the toasted bones in the boiling water alongside 2 carrots, a handful of celery stalks, and the leaf from a Sucrosap Tree.
- Yul remembers a tiny sucrosap sapling in a pot as one of her earliest memories
- One more book, big stash of fanfiction
- As yul approaches, nim drags yul away (because yul is too young to be tainted by the fanfic)
- Bloo walks up to read it, it's a loose binder of looseleaf papers, it starts out fine like a typical story, bloo keeps reading, turning over and over, sift through, nothing especially weird about anything, then get to a weird part, the part that you're reading seems awfully familiar, sounds like someone is writing a "fictional" story based on similar events to what Bloo lived through
- Portrays a very valiant, somewhat muscular, suave hero, notice some details that are inaccurate, the physical description does not match Bloo, this is a self-insert, meant to substitute for details of Sorean, Bloo shuts the book, looks over and says "how inaccurate", this isn't how I used to look like, feel a weird surge of confidence, you're better than what they're describing, see a swirl of glitter, eyes glow blue, gave me +1 cha
- Bloo then rewrites the fanfiction to better describe Sorean
- Nim notices in center of fountain, there's a pressure valve in the center
- Nim rants about why there's a fountain that you can fuck with in the center of the library
- As Nim rants, notices all the books while in this room/temple, are waterproof
- Nim apologizes and stops ranting
- Nim turns the pressure valve, and the water level outside starts rising
- At B2, go up, there's a water bubble that we can breath inside of at the end of the hallway, inside there is statue of Thetis, at bottom of pedestal there is a slot for the sapphire
- [[Characters/NPCs/Gabriel]] warps into the room, "took you long enough"
- Yul casts Hold Person, which does not affect Gabriel, he's not humanoid??
- Gabriel: "that party trick won't be working on me, sorry"
- Bloo: "I don't wanna hear you talk" and eldritch blasts him
- Gabriel deflects them both
- Gabriel: "I said I came to talk, would you really attack me"
- Bloo minor illusions loud noises over Gabriel
- Gabriel slowly gets really really pissed, and then casts a zone of silence
- Bloo counterspells it
- Gabriel: :/
- Nim goes to read the inscription while this happens, it says aqua vitae thetis and "her holy gemstone" for the slot
- Gabriel teleports to the statue, bloo counterspells, and gabriel aggressively walks towards the statue while the silly illusion music plays, gabriel manifests a giant black staff at the statue
- Gabriel: "I suggest you get out of the way"
- Nim slams the sapphire into the statue
- Gabriel teleports over to try to stop Nim, they wrestle
- Bloo walks over to bitch slap Gabriel, with Yul's blessing, Nim wins and jams the sapphire in
- Gabriel: "You won't be happy with what you see, this makes things a little more interesting, but I suggest you stand back"
- Nim steps back, Bloo steps closer, Yul doesn't hear
- Gabriel eyes start glowing a sinister red, takes his staff, at the tip it starts to glow purple, and then Nim flashes purple
- Nim finds it harder to breathe
- Gabriel's staff at the very end, purple energy being drawn away from Nim and converging at the tip of the staff, forms the head of a spear, and he holds it in his left hand
- Nim takes a jar and tries to capture the purple energy
- Sarah runs over to Nim and lays on hands on Nim
- Nim captures some of the purple mist
- Gabriel is pointing the spear at the head of the Thetis statue, which is glowing blue
- Nim and Bloo tackle him, Yul casts blood puppet (bloo silvery barbs), the spear lodges into the wall behind the statue
- Thetis statue smacks Gabriel into the wall behind us, drawing some blood, Yul collects his blood
- Gabriel: "And here I thought you guys wanted to kill the woestrider, looks like you (Sarah) won't be getting this information"
- Gabriel vanishes, spear vanishes with him
- The statue is glowing, there's a blue stream of light going down at the bottom, and it beckons us towards it
- Nim approaches, and is enveloped in the light, to all the others she disappears
- Nim sees nothing but water, splashing around, that water materializes into the form of the statues we saw earlier, a projection of Thetis made of water, "You have done well, thank you for returning my sapphire, I know our meeting will be brief here, but, I wanted to thank you for all your efforts, take the sapphire with you, we'll need it if we need to bring Azathoth back, thank you for freeing me, it's been a while since I've seen this plane of existence, how are you? Are you hurt?"
- Nim: "I wanna know why bringing back Azathoth is smth that will help"
- Thetis: "Azathoth entrusted me and the other elementals with bringing him back, with the very accurate prediction of his demise to N, he is the one you seek war against, right?"
- Nim: "Yeah, I guess, he's fucking up our plane of existence"
- Thetis: "As you know, Azathoth as the one who granted consciousness, was not looked favorably by N, however he entrusted some of is power into us so that we may be wakened, the other elementals are out there, each gemstone holds a fraction of our power so that his crown can bring us back, he'll be more help then Genesis, he never liked being involved in these affairs, and N's ambitions, well, yeah" ^af0c1e
- Nim: "wdym by your message"
- Thetis: "??"
- Nim: "The nyx isn't N"
- Thetis: "That must be one of the scribes, the council of the archmages, long after I was sealed dormant, thetis used her remaining power to guide the clerics, gleamed some information, appears as if the goddess of death, nyx, is not related to N, and they wrote that as a remembrance of the origins of the original pantheon, the 3 primitive gods, they have no direct lineage, i suppose us elementals are the closest thing to a lineage azathoth has, but genesis would be mad to find another god masquerading as a god of life, he was vain, N and genesis balanced each other out, you'd imagine the two would be mortal, or immortal enemies, but that wasn't the case, Genesis, was, well, mortals was complicit in N, but that is not my story to tell, if you wish to hear it, be my guest, but I fear you won't like what you hear"
- Nim: "care to comment on why Gabriel said you weren't all what we would expect"
- Thetis: "I have no ulterior motives, however he has all there reason to try to manipulate you, he appears to be allied with N, but I fear it might be more grave than what you originally thought, your goal is to remove N, it was Azathoth's final wishes, I am here to try to carry it out, I do not wish to bring the struggles of us on the Pantheon to you, mortals, but it appears N is hell bent on doing that, we do not care too much to intervene but some minor blessings are in due, but just know this, that Gabriel fellow, that's just a mask that he wears, he's a lot more dangerous than you think, i saw the way you were taunting him, you all would like Azathoth, and he would like you, he would get along a lot with that certain blood obsessed one" looks down as if looking down on material plane, yul feels as if someone is looking at her
- Nim: "Yul is the person a lot of gods would find entertaining"
- Thetis: "Azathoth thought it was quite entertaining, he grew fond of humanity, that's why he tries to defend you from N's wrath, but know this, the 8 generals of N's army, you might've prevented 1 from coming, but 2 are already in your plane"
- Nim: "Any hints on elementals?"
- Thetis: "You're in luck, my brother's temple is already on your path, in fact one of you might've already been there unwittingly, the paladin that prays to Clarus, let's say Prometheus and Clarus would get along well, you'll find his temple in Celestial Peak, perhaps off the beaten path, oh and you look a little worse to wear"
- Thetis blows water towards Nim, it wraps around Nim, you feel lighter
- Thetis: "I will grant an additional blessing to your adventure friends, I converse with you, I seek not to convert you to our faith, but if you are fighting N, you have my blessing, I would like to say, defensively, that we elementals never try to intervene with your plane"
- Thetis: "A word of warning, the council may not necessarily like you for uncovering all this truth, but I wonder what it is this elf was trying to do, befriending some during her tenure there, I am not all knowing unfortunately, though N and Genesis act as if they are, one final note, I would like to say, if you've read the annals, all the bitching is completely true"
- Thetis: "I will send you  back to your plane"
- Nim: "Which two servants made it into this realm?"
- Thetis: "For the ones on your plane, (I believe), 2 of the most dangerous ones are, Ruin and Abyss, Abyss is hard to fathom embodies emptiness, I remember the poor souls, immortal though they be, Veritus died to Abyss, she was slain by Emptiness in an unfortunate turn of events, many of those who spawn from Azathoth didn't make it. The other, the strongest, Ruin, I haven't come toe to toe with them myself, but from the memories from Azathoth, Ruin has the ability to destroy anything he comes in contact or near with, if he regains hsi full poiwer, he alone could wipe out all of falterra himself, but they're not fully powered, like the ones from the planes, hades, the one you stopped, they have forms in the material plane, but they don't have all their power yet. Find the source of their power and cut it off, maybe it'll help you end them permanently, but I'm sure they'll try to bring the others back"
- Thetis: "I must send you back, our time is running out"
- Nim: "It was interesting to get to talk to you"
- Thetis: "I wish I had more to offer, but i don't believe I'm one of the gods, as they say, be careful meeting your heroes, may you hav eblessings on the battles ahead"
- Nim wakes up, reappears, water swirls her form and then she appears
- The statue stops glowing
- One final blessing, one of the four of us can take, the one to reclaim the sapphire gets the blessing
- Nim takes the sapphire, she feels invigorated, she feels a lot better, Nim gets a minor blessing of Thetis, Drop of Life, twice per long rest, can regain 1d12 + character level hit points
- 2 more gifts parted to Nim, hear a click of a lock a distance away, all the water barriers are now gone, can now freely traverse regardless of water level
- On B4, we swim across and open a chest to see 2 superior potions of healing
- We can now freely enter and exit the temple as there is a teleport circle
- The sapphire is glowing once more
-
