	- [[Yul]]
	- [[Sarah]]

- Previous session: [[28 - 05.12.2025 - God Damn It, Gaybriel Part 2]] 
##### Important Points: 
- Seliph finds a deep gnome who is allied with Tabitha, the big witch who sank our ship and took Sarah's ring (took it back?)
- Turns out they're trying to sell the ring to many people in Half Moon Bay and it's hard to take it off and you remove its curse the wearer just dies
### 04.21.0347 Dusk| Desert Island
- The captain is doing a bit better
- Captain: what did y'all find in the temple?
- Hear some waves crashing, doesn't sound like waves crashing against the shore
- See a trail of mist far off in the distance closing in on us
- Feel very salty ocean mist, see something skidding across the sand, see a very exhausted Seliph
- In his arm, has a deep gnome that was on the ship
- Seliph smacks him, "WAKE UP!", *very very* tired
- Seliph: "This rat bastard, grr, he's involved with that damn witch that sank the ship, I knocked him out and dragged him here with my bare hands, because we need him alive, to interrogate him, he's going to give us information, and how to get the hell out of here"
- Seliph pulls out a paper and small pouch, "sarah, or someone responsible, hold this for me, this is a scroll that has an incantation, and it is meant to automatically go off if he dies, after 9 days, it's a spell scroll to revive him, probably a contingency"
- Bloo casts Detect Thoughts, hears a flood of thoughts, "oh shit, oh god, where is it" looking for something in his pockets
- "Oh shit, the devil is going to  kill me, I should've never made a deal with her in the first place, Tabitha"
	- Thoughts about panicking with Tabitha, and how much he owes
- Gnome: "Nothing is worse than dealing with that witch, I've already sold my soul, what left is there to give" Reaching for his pocket, hear metal clinging, thoughts of "I can end this, so I can't speak"
- Yul casts Hold Person
- He's gripping a dagger
- Sarah takes his dagger, and throws it into the ocean, Sarah also takes his money
- He has a business card, "Tabitha's Witch Hut of Healing"
- Seliph goes to take a walk, the captain follows
- The deep gnome is paralyzed
- Gnome: "I didn't sign up for this, was supposed to bring my target to the destination, but Tabitha intervened, she said she wouldn't"
- Gnome: tall, suit of armor, Gabriel, but he doesn't know his name, only physical description
- Gnome: "I was just supposed to hand out rings, I just needed a ring"
- Gnome: "I dunno what Tabitha was thinking, does she only want me to suffer?"
- Gnome is a middleman
- Gnome: "I didn't ask for that spell, or that scroll, I just want this all to end, if any of you can hear my thoughts, just let me die, I don't want to be indebted to her"
- Gnome: "She gets total ownership of me, she's trying to make [[The Hyritian Alliance#Valzelia|Valzelia]] better for other people, it makes people happier, I was just a simple grifter
- The spell scroll goes off automatically if the person holding it dies
- Seliph tells Nim to throw the jar of purple stuff into the ocean, after we debrief him on Gabriel
- Nim notices the obelisk is glowing blue, and water comes out the top
- The water forms a hand, becoming like a boat
- Investigating Gabriel's helmet, feel sinister magic lurking within, feel something drawing you in, it wants to be put on
- Nim subconsciously is putting it on
- Yul bonks Nim on the head
- Nim gives the helmet to Sarah
- Sarah slashes at it with her sword, it cracks and melts/fizzles away, can still feel the presence of its magic
- Yul dispels the magic
- Sarah casts Locate Object, can't detect the statuette
- We decide to use the materials and the revive spell scroll to revive the captain's second in command, Patron
- Patron gets up and kicks the gnome in the balls, then shin
- We get on the Thetis water boat
- We update Seliph on what's going on with Thetis and whatnot
- We make it to half moon bay
- We arrive at crescent boardwalk, the sun is mostly down, everything is shutting down, welcomed by a confused sailor
- Tells us our lodgings by central market, taverns still open, stuff is closing though
- After arguing about who's covering for food, Seliph takes us to a nice waterfront seafood restaurant
- Seliph orders hella seafood boils and stuff
- Seliph and Sarah fight for the claws in the crab
- Bloo decides it's a handstand contest, silvery barbs Seliph, alas it doesn't help
- We eat, go to the hotel
- The hotel man likes my yogurt
- We ask about tourism, and temple of prometheus
- He says only temples here are for the celestials
- We go to sleep
