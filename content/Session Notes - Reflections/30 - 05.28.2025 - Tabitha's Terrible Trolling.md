##### Important Points: 
### 04.22.0347 | [[Faltera/Hyritia/The Hyritian Alliance#Half Moon Bay\|Half Moon Bay, Valzelia]]
- Bloo and Yul gets the reverend at the church
- Choir is singing, acoustics are nice
- We wait for the reverend
- Tall dignified man, kind of old, hair line receding, this is Doctor Arlo Meadow, face and skin look quite young for his age, estimate to be about in his 50s, wearing a large, oversized, robe, pristine white, gold trim and blue sparkles, ornament in center tying the robes together, has the symbol of Lummus, the goddess of the moon
	- Has a ring, has a sigil of Lummus etched on it, not Tabitha ring
- Bloo explains the situation to Doctor Meadow as they drag him to the store
- Doctor Meadow is shocked, never heard of Tabitha, heard of the ring store but hasn't heard of the rings
- Doctor Meadow is stressed with this entire situation
- Fletcher is nervous to see Doctor Meadow
- The fletcher apparently "feels a lot happier" after putting the ring on
- Ring was given by his friend, who also gave it to his little sister, his friend said it "made him feel happier"
- Doctor Meadow looks at his hands
- Nim says he should take the ring off, fletcher gets defensive, Sarah threatens to cut off his hand, fletcher says, "that won't be necessary"
- Fletcher is super defensive, "no… my ring, it's special to me"
- Reverend takes his hand, after convincing the fletcher to stick his hand out
- Reverend chants, the ring starts glowing, color fades from gold to faded gray, it snaps into many pieces, see another distinct look of fear on the fletcher, man doesn't look like he's been liberated, he looks at his hand, and then hear a thud
- Reverend continues onto a different incantation, everyone feels put at ease as he slowly resurrects this man, just as quickly as he gets back up, see the hand that had the ring on it start to twitch, the hand is starting to be drained of color and decayed
- Reverend is trying to heal it, "I've never seen a blight like this before", the man reels back and yanks his hand back, and starts looking more agitated, "Don't take that away from me"
- The reverend ends up leaving because he doesn't want to witness what we're about to do, and have plausible deniability about Sarah cutting off his hand
- Bloo and Nim tackle the guy down, Nim "helps", Bloo pins him to the ground
- Sarah lops the hand off, as it flies through the air, see muscle fibers extend out of the hand, and from his wrist, it is also sprouting muscle tendons, trying to reconnect together
- Sarah smites the hand
- The hand glows brilliantly as it is sliced in two, hear screams of pain and agony from outside
- The fletcher is screaming in pain
- Nim walks outside to see the reverend running towards someone, outside the alley there is a few people gathered
- Nim and Yul follows the reverend, who is trying to ease the pain of someone, look at their left hand, and the top section, where the top 4 fingers are, are missing, cut clean off, and it appears the wound instantly cauterized and is smoking and glowing brightly
- Nim picks the door to the blacksmith, and sees the body looks dry, aged, mummified almost, decayed, it smells *rancid* as if it's been decomposing for a long time
- His fingers are intact
- Hear screaming coming from around, but don't see anyone in the alleyway
- Nim notices that the body is turning into dust, see ash like particles fall off into the air
- Notice some markings on his head that weren't there previously, it's not a script but a sigil, very haunting sigil, recognize it as, written in ash, written on the floorboards, this is a sigil associated with Nyarlathotep
- ![[../Pasted image 20250528193718.png|200]]
- Now Nim only smells smoke, ash, and dust
- Might be Ruin, N's general thing
- Nim suspects that it must have appeared after the body was decaying and drying, but it must've been a *few minutes* after we left
- The fletcher's hand that was cut in half has disintegrated, the tendons in the wrist have stopped wriggling
- The fletcher's voice starts to hand: "I neeeeeeedd iiittt", it's the hags voice, his eyes start to glow green as they're flashing out, "I neeeeeeddd the riiinnnggg", feel the body spasming out, left shoulder joint snapped backwards, the barren wrist, can slowly see the msucles restitch together, reshaping his hand, but it looks withered, the muscle is slowly refilling with skin, and on his left ring finger, is a ring
- "You can not get rid of this, I declare all of these rings and they are mine, I declared them as mine, and you cannot have any of them, break any more of my precious toys and I'll break all the minds of those who wear them" 
- Bloo tries to bonk, misses, the head turns 180 degrees to look at bloo, "you can't hurt me with bludgeoning or magic"
- "You can't find me, you'll die of old age first"
- Nim notices there's a hatch behind the counter, there is no damage to the window
- See weapons in backroom, see giant air vent connected to furnace, likely the forge but it's inactive right now
- Nim feels like they're being watched, but doesn't see anyone, no window, only way out is air vent which is connected to the back of the forge
- Whatever was watching you, don't feel like they're there anymore
- Nim uses Mage Hand to dig around the ashes, finds a coin, not currency, but it looks like someone made a coin, the coin says "it's a voucher, but a special voucher, from the guild", it appears to be a commemorative coin and proof of guild membership
- Metal stuff, buttons and buckles, didn't disintegrate, all the fabric, textiles gone, organic material disintegrated
- Chain bracelet, has a sigil of the God of the Stars, in the ashes, he himself does not worship the God of Fortune, so no superstition of money in the afterlife
- Yul is with the reverend, trying to heal the dude's hand, but then a scream of agony as four bones sprout out of the top half of the hand, muscles start to regrow, and then the hand regrows, but also on this hand is a ring that grew back
- Nim walks outside, the reverend looks exhausted and asks for assistance
- The reverend grabs the hand, "No…, I mustn't" but he's squeezing it tightly
- The reverend presses deeper into the wrist bone, and then breaks his bones, then heals it again
- Nim tells the reverend about the body turning into ashes
- The reverend didn't break the wrist bone, only healed to stabilize the injury, he looks mortified
- Nim tells Yul to give the reverend shoulder pats
- Reverend looks at Yul, "Are you okay?" "I have no brain"
- Reverend: "I'm gonna have a heart attack, this is all happening so fast"
- Nim goes to Bloo and Sarah
- Reverend walks over slowly, looking mortified, and gives a shell pat to Bloo
- Sarah: "Do you have holy water?"
- Bloo gets off the dude
- Reverend says, "I'll handle this"
- Reverend restrains the fletcher as the fletcher gets up, he pours some holy water on the guys head, and then snaps the head back to normal
- Reverend: "This is a dark day in the history of Half Moon Bay"
- Nim tells the reverend about the pile of ash of the blacksmith
- Nim ties up the fletcher
- Reverend dips his two fingers into the holy water, and then goes for the eyes, so he is "temporarily blinded by the radiance"
- The reverend says "I must take my leave, I think I need some time to think and reflect and get the other members of my church"
- We walk to the ring shop
- It is closed
- Nim lockpicks the door
- We walk in, flip the sign to open, as soon as we all walk in, the door slams shut, hear a zhwoooooop, and then a click
- We feel that there was an attempt to watch us, there were eyes on us, as we look around, it's unusually empty, glass counter with many rings but doesn't match the rings that match with the cursed ones
- This looks like a regular ring store, but it's slightly magical
- Notice at our feet, two sigils, in ash, which seem to have just "magically appeared"
- One appears to be the same one that Nim saw earlier, and the second one seems to be for the school of necromancy
- ![[../Pasted image 20250528202109.png|200]]
- Sarah wipes the sigils with her boot, it appears to be ash, but it seems to be magically placed there
- See some bookshelves and paintings that look moved around, that look crooked
- One of the paintings, a painting depicting a battle that was fought at some point, it appears to be a gap behind it
- As soon as Nim touches the paintings, a glyph appears on the ground
- Unfortunately Sarah is now blinded
- There's a button behind the painting
- Nim presses it, the room starts shaking very loudly, something is moving that's causing it to shake, there's a hatch that is revealed through all the shaking
- Sarah stops being blind
- We open the hatch, it's a ladder, can't see all the way to the bottom
- It took at least 3 seconds, maybe 6 seconds, to get to the bottom, somewhere in there it becomes magical darkness
- Yul goes down a little to cast dispel magic on the magic darkness, as it subsides and fades away, it's a very narrow tube of concrete, and it's just a straight shot down
- We all climb down the ladder for minutes
- Keep climbing, no sign of the bottom
- We climb up, Sarah is at the top, then Bloo, Yul, then Nim
- As Sarah looks up, sees Nim, Yul, Bloo, it's a loop!
- Yul casts Dispel Magic, look down, see the ground
- Also hear voices, snickering, laughing
- "Sooo you decide to come here, right into the lair, is that the wisest decision"
- "I am everywhere"
- You end up at the bottom, "Huh? What are you doing here?"
- See Seliph at the bottom
- Seliph was investigating the shipwreck, "glad to see we reconvened at an oddly convenient time"
- Seliph concluded that the person who shipwrecked us must be down here
- Seliph: "I can smell the evil"
- Seliph tried to find us but couldn't, tried asking around about weird occurrences, I was asking in fisherman's wharf, he points over at a light, I think that's where the evil is coming off
- Seliph: "Come over here!"
- Immediately feel an attempt to be scried, someone watching us
- Seliph feels fake, Sarah asks about the milk situation, but Seliph gets it wrong
- Sarah: "How do you spell it?"
- Seliph: "Orsterra"
- Sarah: "And what does it mean?"
- Seliph: *silence*
- Bloo: "Where are you?" Sending to Seliph
- Seliph: "At the castle, why?"
- Bloo hears something, "Hello I am with Seliph right now, please use me as a response channel"
- Bloo: "Who are you??"
- See a gulf of fire out of that room, hear a Seliph scream
- Sarah: "You should just walk out of the fire bro"
- Not Seliph: "Fine…" in witch voice
- Visages of Seliph float in front of us, "I should've know that you wouldn't be this stupid, but you are stupid enough to follow us down here"
- See shadows of Seliph and other random passerbys, "Well then, if you would be so kind", hear a snap of fingers, suddenly can't see the ladder
- Hear boney footsteps on the concrete, a figure is walking towards us
- Bloo sending to Seliph: "Rings of Bling, secret hatch, Tabitha lair, send help, ask revered meadows or dongle man for clarification on rings, uhm" (also had to make a check, so we're on a different dimension)
- Seliph: "i'm heading over rn, stay put"
- Suddenly, the visages suddenly swap to random other people, the people wearing rings
- Every single cloud in front of us, "I control their life, they give it to me", it looks like she's being lifted up, and you look down, you're falling
- Nim casts feather fall
- Feel weird force of gravity on you, like you're floating down, hear a snap of fingers, and suddenly being pulled down by something, hear her laugh, see gassy projections of people you've seen wearing rings, "you're only going to leave when I'm dead, nooo, I'm sure you'll never leave, because I'll never die"
- "Enjoy being in your prison of falling"
- Feel something pulling on all of us, see spectral hands grabbing you all, separating us
- We hold hands, Sarah gets dragged away somewhere else
- There is something blindingly white we're getting pulled into, but who knows what it is??
-
